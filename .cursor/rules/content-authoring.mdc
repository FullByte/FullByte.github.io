### Content Management (for `docs/**/*.md` files)

- New articles are created as `.md` files within the appropriate subdirectories of `docs/`.
- When adding images, place them in the same directory as the article or a subdirectory. Reference them with relative paths.
- The `image_optimizer.py` script will automatically process and optimize any new images during the build process.
- Before committing, it's good practice to run `python check_media_paths.py` to find broken image or media links.
