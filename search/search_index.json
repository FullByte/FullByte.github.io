If you work in a social or public based service make sure to create awareness but don't let uninvolved suffer from your problems.

They want you to listen. If they want advice but it doesn't work, here are some possible reasons to reflect on:</p> Topic Problem Solution Mismatch with Situation Advice often doesn't consider the unique details of the individual's context. Tailor advice to specifically fit the complexities and nuances of each situation. Cognitive Bias People may ignore advice due to subconscious biases or reluctance to change. Encourage self-awareness and challenge existing biases through reflective questioning. Lack of Detail General or vague advice fails to be actionable. Provide specific, actionable steps and examples to clarify how advice can be implemented. Poor Timing Advice given when the recipient isn't receptive won't be effective. Choose an opportune moment for giving advice when the individual is most open to listening. Resistance to Change Natural resistance to change can prevent advice from being followed. Address emotional barriers and facilitate a supportive environment that encourages change. Overload of Information Too much advice can overwhelm and paralyze the decision-making process. Focus on delivering concise, prioritized advice rather than a multitude of options. Lack of Trust Lack of trust in the advisor can lead to skepticism about the advice given. Build trust through empathy, consistent support, and by demonstrating understanding and expertise. Perceived Patronization Advice may be perceived as patronizing, reducing its effectiveness. Ensure advice is delivered respectfully and considerately to foster a positive reception. Irrelevance of Advice Sometimes advice is not applicable because it's based on incorrect assumptions. Verify assumptions and gather accurate information about the situation before advising. Unrealistic Expectations Expectations that advice alone will solve complex problems can lead to disappointment. Set realistic expectations about what advice can achieve and emphasize effort and process."},{"location":"about/life/social.html#rules-to-live-by","title":"Rules to live by","text":"<ol> <li>Gehe im Zweifelsfall vom Guten aus (lieber 1x verarscht werden als 100x kein vertrauen gezeigt)</li> <li>Denke in Win-Win-Szenarien (Bei guten Deals gewinnen alle)</li> <li>Verbessere die Welt - Stelle eine Frage (XXXXXX)</li> <li>Z\u00fcgle Deine Empathie (mitleiden), trainiere Dein Mitgef\u00fchl (Mitleid)</li> <li>Versuche den Anderen zu verstehen; auch wenn Du kein Verst\u00e4ndnis aufbringen kannst</li> <li>Liebe Deinen N\u00e4chsten so wie auch andere ihre N\u00e4chsten lieben</li> <li>Meide die Nachrichten (Mainstream Media, Personenbezogene Nachrichten und sensationsgeile Quellen)</li> <li>Pr\u00fcgele Dich nicht mit Nazis (sei Schlau im Konter geben und demonstrieren)</li> <li>Oute Dich (XXXXXX)</li> <li>Sei realistisch (sei kein Tr\u00e4umer und kein Pessimist)</li> </ol>"},{"location":"about/life/social.html#more-rules","title":"More Rules","text":"<p>More good advice I collected from random places over time:</p> <p>Showing sometimes is 50%:</p> <ul> <li>Quote: \"Show up is better than not showing up\" or \"Anything worth doing is also worth doing half assed\".</li> <li>Example: brushing your teeth for 10 seconds is better than 0 seconds, etc. apply that to everything..</li> </ul>"},{"location":"about/me/index.html","title":"Me","text":"<p>Some facts about me:</p> <ul> <li>I found my great white buffalo \ud83e\udde1</li> <li>I climb, ski, ride and run with passion \ud83d\udd25</li> <li>I spend most of my time with tech, games and music \ud83e\udd16</li> <li>I make stuff (mainly board games and stuff with the laser cutter) \ud83c\udfb2</li> <li>I believe pineapple pizza is not a crime \ud83c\udf55</li> <li>I think the best time of the day is 22:22 \ud83d\udd70</li> <li>I say \"Entweder es klappt oder es klappt zusammen.\" \ud83d\ude24</li> </ul> <p>Last link i visited which I would like to share:</p>"},{"location":"about/me/index.html#it-background","title":"IT background","text":"<p>My first interaction with a PC was in 1991.

draw a hungry hamster and asks to make the crated image even hungrier with every iteration. The result is hilarious so I tried my own version :)</p> <p>To get ideas I used this Prompt:</p> <p>Answer in the form \"thing\" - \"property\" - \"what to exaggerate\" and list 10 ideas. Name me something simple to draw and a property for that thing. The property should be something which can be drawn simple as well as very exaggerated.</p> <p>I went with an elegant owl with the goal to exaggerate its elegance. Here are the results:</p> <p>Stage 1: Here are the images of the elegant owl sitting on a tree branch under the moonlight.</p> <p></p> <p>Stage 2: Here are the enhanced images of the highly elegant owl.</p> <p></p> <p>Stage 3: Here are the images of the owl, now with an even more elegant appearance.</p> <p></p> <p>Stage 4: Here are the images showcasing the owl in an even more elegant and sophisticated setting.</p> <p></p> <p>Stage 5: Here are the images representing the owl in its most elegant and majestic form ever.</p> <p></p> <p>Stage 6: Creating an image that surpasses the current level of elegance portrayed in the last depiction could be challenging, as the previous images already represent a highly elevated concept of elegance. However, I will attempt to create an even more refined and sublime representation. Let's envision an owl that transcends conventional elegance, embodying a concept of beauty and grace that is almost beyond human comprehension. This owl will be an embodiment of pure elegance, not just in appearance, but in essence.</p> <p></p> <p>Stage 7: To create an image that embodies an even higher level of elegance, I will envision an owl that is not just an entity in itself, but a representation of elegance as a universal concept. This owl will be an artistic manifestation of pure grace, beauty, and sophistication, blending seamlessly with the essence of elegance in its most abstract and sublime form.</p> <p></p> <p>Stage 8: To further enhance the elegance, let's imagine an owl that not only embodies elegance in its physical form but also in its essence, transcending even the cosmic realm. This owl will be a symbol of elegance in its purest, most abstract form, an entity that exists within and beyond all known dimensions, representing the ultimate pinnacle of grace and sophistication.</p> <p></p> <p>Stage 9: To maximize the elegance to its utmost potential, I'll imagine an owl that is not just a symbol or embodiment of elegance, but rather the origin and the ultimate expression of elegance in the universe. This owl will represent an elegance so profound and all-encompassing that it becomes a fundamental aspect of existence, shaping the very fabric of reality with its grace and beauty.</p> <p></p> <p>Stage 10: To depict the final form of elegance, we'll envision an owl that transcends all known concepts and visual representations of elegance. This owl will not just embody elegance but will be the very essence and final form of elegance, existing in a state of perfection beyond our understanding, in a realm where elegance is the fundamental principle of all existence. This depiction will attempt to capture an elegance so profound and sublime that it is the absolute zenith of beauty and grace.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"make/art/digital/pytorch.html","title":"pytorch","text":"<p>Install tools:</p> <ul> <li>Install CUDA: https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads</li> <li>Install Miniconda: https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html</li> </ul> <p>Check status of nvidia settings:</p> <pre><code>nvidia-smi\nnvcc -V\n</code></pre> <p>Install tools using Miniconda CLI:</p> <pre><code>conda install numpy ninja pyyaml mkl mkl-include setuptools cmake cffi typing_extensions future six requests dataclasses\nconda install -c conda-forge libuv=1.39 # Windows\n</code></pre> <p>PyTorch does not use the systems CUDA library.

This idea can be interpreted in various ways depending on the context:</p> <pre><code>Philosophical and Metaphysical Interpretation: Philosophically, this statement might be aligned with the concept of dialectics, which is central in the philosophies of Hegel and Marx, among others. In this view, every idea or condition (thesis) inevitably generates its opposite (antithesis), and the interaction or conflict between these leads to a new stage or condition (synthesis), which in turn becomes a new thesis, continuing the cycle. This is a process of perpetual self-creation and transformation.\nPsychological Interpretation: From a psychological standpoint, it might suggest that our actions and thoughts often produce unintended consequences or reactions. For instance, an extreme emphasis on happiness can sometimes lead to an awareness or creation of its opposite, sadness or dissatisfaction, which might then motivate a person to seek balance or understanding, thus perpetuating a cycle of self-exploration and change.\nPhysical or Natural Sciences Interpretation: In the realm of physics or natural sciences, this could be seen as reflecting certain principles such as Newton's Third Law of Motion (\"For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction\") or the concept of ecological balance, where actions in nature often create counter-actions, maintaining a dynamic equilibrium.\nCultural and Societal Interpretation: In cultural or societal terms, this statement can reflect how social movements or cultural trends often give rise to opposing views or counter-movements, which then influence the original movement, leading to continuous evolution in culture and society.\n</code></pre> <p>Each of these interpretations reflects a different aspect of the idea that everything is in a constant state of flux and interaction, with forces and ideas perpetually generating their opposites and thereby creating cycles of change and rebirth.</p>"},{"location":"make/art/literal/disinformation.html","title":"Disinformation","text":"<p>Spreading false information as a tactic is as old as history itself. Incidentally, the term \"disinformation\" comes from the Russian word \"Dezinformatsiya\", which was coined by the Soviet secret police in the 1920s. Since the advent of the internet, especially with the introduction of Web 2.0, the spread of disinformation has increased significantly. Everyone has the opportunity to disseminate their views globally and present their interpretation of the truth. Recently, content created by artificial intelligence in particular, such as convincing deepfakes, has contributed to an increase in this phenomenon.</p> <p>Creating potentially credible content on any topic or agenda is easier and cheaper than ever before thanks to AI. As a result, information is generally no longer of high value, while authentic and reliable information is becoming increasingly valuable. However, verifying the credibility of sources remains a challenge. Technical means of authenticating messages, such as digital watermarks, signatures or time stamps, do exist, but are rarely used in practice by citizens for world news, for example.</p> <p>According to the World Economic Forum's Global Risks Report 2024, disinformation, particularly that generated by AI, is categorized as one of the most urgent global risks. The World Economic Forum points out that in response to the increase in misinformation and disinformation, governments may become more inclined to control information according to their own definition of \"truth\". This could further restrict already diminishing freedoms on the internet, in the press and in access to comprehensive sources of information, and lead to increased suppression of the flow of information in many countries.</p> <p>I see disinformation as one of the most pressing problems in the coming years and see the risk of censorship, the undermining of press freedom and the increasing power of large platforms. At the same time, I hope that technical solutions for verifying the authenticity of information will be increasingly used in news and media in the future. Just as Napster has triggered a revolution in streaming media and PayPal in online commerce, I hope that AI will ultimately provide the decisive impetus to fundamentally change the way we consume information and news and promote positive development in the process.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"make/art/literal/movie-series.html","title":"Movie Series","text":""},{"location":"make/art/literal/movie-series.html#the-art-of-movie-series-ordering-crafting-narratives-beyond-time","title":"The Art of Movie Series Ordering: Crafting Narratives Beyond Time","text":"<p>In the realm of cinema, the sequence of a movie series is more than just a timeline; it's a canvas for storytelling. Take the iconic \"Star Wars\" and \"The Godfather\" sagas, where the non-linear narrative has become a hallmark of their storytelling. This approach, where the past and future intertwine, invites audiences to piece together a larger, more complex puzzle, enriching the viewing experience.</p> <p>Consider the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), a masterclass in expanded universe storytelling. It's a tapestry of sequels, prequels, and standalone films, each contributing to a grand narrative. This method of storytelling has redefined audience expectations, blending individual tales into a cohesive, interconnected universe.</p> <p>Then there's the intriguing concept of retroactive continuity, or retcon, as seen in series like \"X-Men.\" Here, new films can alter the fabric of their own universe, breathing new life into established lore and keeping narratives fresh and engaging.</p> <p>These storytelling techniques reflect not just creative ambitions but also cultural and historical contexts. For instance, the evolution of the James Bond series mirrors shifting societal norms and attitudes, adapting its themes to stay relevant.</p> <p>Perhaps most fascinating is the role of the audience in all this. Fans actively engage with these complex timelines, creating their own viewing orders to uncover new layers of the narrative. This interaction between filmmaker and viewer is a testament to the power of storytelling and its ability to connect across different mediums.</p> <p>In conclusion, the sequencing of movie series is an art form that transcends traditional narrative structures, offering a richer, more immersive cinematic experience. It's a testament to the ever-evolving nature of storytelling and its enduring impact on audiences worldwide.</p>"},{"location":"make/art/literal/movie-series.html#examples","title":"Examples","text":"<p>Transformers</p> <ul> <li>Bumblebee (2018)</li> <li>Transformers: Rise of the Beasts (2023)</li> <li>Transformers (2007)</li> <li>Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen (2009)</li> <li>Transformers: Dark of the Moon (2011)</li> <li>Transformers: Age of Extinction (2014)</li> <li>Transformers: The Last Knight (2017)</li> </ul> <p>Insidious</p> <ul> <li>Insidious: Chapter 3</li> <li>Insidious: The Last Key</li> <li>Insidious</li> <li>Insidious: Chapter 2</li> <li>Insidious: The Red Door</li> <li>Thread: An Insidious Tale (presumably, when it comes out)</li> </ul> <p>Alien</p> <ul> <li>AVP: Alien vs Predator (2004)</li> <li>Aliens vs Predator -

Generally, here a few things to consider:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Beans and packaging: Whole coffee beans retain their freshness and flavor much longer than pre-ground coffee. Grinding the beans just before brewing ensures the best flavor. Good coffee roasters use airtight bags with one-way valves that release gases while preventing air from entering. Look for coffee beans with a recent roast date. Coffee is at its peak freshness within a few weeks of roasting. Avoid beans that are several months old or coffee without roast date. This type of packaging helps maintain freshness. Open the bag and take a whiff. Fresh beans should have a strong, pleasant aroma that matches the flavor notes described. Beans that appear overly oily or shiny might be over-roasted or old. A moderate sheen is acceptable, but excessive oiliness can indicate poor quality.</p> </li> <li> <p>Buy from reputable roasters: Local coffee shops often carry beans from local or regional roasters. You can ask baristas for recommendations based on your preferences. Purchase coffee beans from reputable specialty coffee roasters. They often source high-quality beans, roast them with care, and provide detailed information about the beans' origin and flavor profile. Roasters often provide tasting notes describing the coffee's flavor and aroma characteristics. Coffee beans are roasted to different levels, from light to dark. Experiment with various roast levels to find the one that suits your taste. Many specialty coffee roasters offer subscription services that deliver fresh beans to your doorstep regularly.</p> </li> <li> <p>Coffee Origin: Different coffee-growing regions produce beans with distinct flavors. Research the regions you enjoy and experiment with their offerings. Single-origin coffee beans come from a specific region or farm, allowing you to experience the unique flavors of that area. Blends are also popular and can offer a balanced taste.</p> </li> </ul> <p>I like these:</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"make/food/coffee/espresso.html#coffee-bean-storage","title":"Coffee bean storage","text":"<p>Behave correctly:</p> <ul> <li>No matter your storage solution, minimize the coffee beans exposure to air, light, moisture, and heat. Heat means nothing over room temperature. No need to freeze beans, in fact this is bad.</li> <li>Use the Beans within 2-4 weeks and use a package size accordingly. Coffee beans have a peak freshness period. While they can be good for a few months, their flavor will start to deteriorate over time.</li> <li>Avoid Constant Opening: Minimize the number of times you open the container. Each time you open the container, you introduce air and moisture that can contribute to flavor loss.</li> <li>Do Not Mix Old and New Beans: If you purchase new coffee beans, avoid mixing them with any leftover older beans. This can dilute the flavor and freshness of the newer batch.</li> </ul> <p>Based on this i follow this setup:</p> <ul> <li>Use the original bag and keep it as airtight as possible. Refill every week or so into my daily use airtight container. Choose the bag size so that I can refill the airtight container up to 4 times. I store the bag in the kitchen drawer.</li> <li>Use an airtight container for daily use. Size is about the size needed for a week. Clean this once the bag is empty. I store the container next to my coffee equipment for easy use.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"make/food/coffee/espresso.html#grind-beans","title":"Grind beans","text":"<p>Grinding coffee beans to the correct fineness is crucial for making a good espresso. The grind size directly affects how quickly water flows through the coffee grounds, which in turn impacts the flavor, aroma, and crema in your espresso shot.</p>"},{"location":"make/food/coffee/espresso.html#setup-grinder","title":"Setup grinder","text":"<p>Always use whole beans and grind them just before brewing. This helps to preserve the flavor compounds and aromatic oils within the beans.</p> <p>Start by defining your starting point by turning the adjustment dial clockwise till the crank handle won\u2019t spin freely without any resistance.</p> <p>Then turn the adjustment dial anti-clockwise to your preferred grind size.</p> <p></p> <p>For my JX-Pro grinder the following settings are recommended by 1zpresso:</p> <p></p> <p>For Espresso this is about 1.5 rotation = turn counter-clockwise a round and 5 numbers. (60 clicks).</p> <p>Start here and adjust according to your results. Here's how you can tell if your coffee beans have been ground properly for espresso:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Extraction Time: Espresso extraction time is the time it takes for water to pass through the coffee grounds in your espresso machine. A properly ground espresso should take about 25 to 30 seconds to extract a shot. If it takes significantly less time, the coffee is likely ground too coarsely; if it takes significantly more time, the coffee is likely ground too fine.</p> </li> <li> <p>Crema Formation: The crema is the golden-brown layer of foam that forms on top of a well-pulled espresso shot. It contains the volatile compounds that contribute to the aroma and flavor of the espresso. If you notice that your crema is too dark and your espresso tastes bitter or overly strong, it's a good indication that your grind is too fine.</p> </li> <li> <p>Taste and Flavor: The taste of the espresso is a clear indicator of whether the beans have been ground properly. If the coffee tastes sour or weak, it might be under-extracted, which could be due to a too-coarse grind. If it tastes bitter or overly strong, it might be over-extracted, which could be due to a too-fine grind. A well-ground espresso should have a balanced and full flavor.</p> </li> <li> <p>Visual Appearance: After tamping the coffee grounds into the portafilter, the puck should have a smooth and even surface. If the puck is crumbly or falls apart easily, the grind might be too coarse. If the puck is too hard and difficult to extract, the grind might be too fine.</p> </li> <li> <p>Flow Rate: Watch the flow of espresso as it comes out of the portafilter. It should be a steady, even stream, resembling honey dripping. If the espresso is coming out too fast (like water), the grind might be too coarse. If it's coming out too slowly (like a drip), the grind might be too fine.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"make/food/coffee/espresso.html#maintenance","title":"Maintenance","text":""},{"location":"make/food/coffee/espresso.html#jx-pro","title":"JX Pro","text":"<p>The JX Pro from 1zpresso is a great coffee grinder.</p> <p>Here is a tutorial on how to clean and maintain the JX-Pro grinder.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"make/food/coffee/espresso.html#9barista","title":"9barista","text":""},{"location":"make/food/coffee/espresso.html#replace-safety-valve","title":"Replace safety valve","text":"<p>The 9barista is a great stove top espresso machine.</p> <p>The safety valve is the one thing that will damage first if the 9barista overheats.

The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs. Here are some strategies to improve your chances of winning in Connect Four:</p> <ul> <li>Aim for the Center: Controlling the center of the board allows you more opportunities to build your row both vertically and horizontally. Placing a disc in the middle column gives you the most options for creating connections in all directions.</li> <li>Plan Ahead: Always think a few moves ahead. This will help you not only set up your own threats but also anticipate and block your opponent\u2019s threats. Try to create multiple opportunities where you could win in the next few moves.</li> <li>Create Multiple Threats: Force your opponent into a defensive position by creating two threats at once. This could mean setting up potential connections in a way that if your opponent blocks one, you can complete the other.</li> <li>Vertical Fours: Since discs can only be stacked vertically, building towards a vertical four can sometimes be easier than aiming for diagonal or horizontal fours, especially in columns that aren't heavily occupied.</li> <li>Watch for Diagonals: Diagonal lines are harder to spot and block than horizontal or vertical ones. Pay close attention to the potential diagonal connections you can make, and also be vigilant about blocking your opponent's diagonals.</li> <li>Block Opponents: Always be on the lookout for a chance where your opponent is about to connect four. It\u2019s crucial to play defensively when needed to block their connections.</li> <li>Use the opponent's disc against them: Sometimes you can set up a two-way trap where you use the discs your opponent has placed to create a dual threat, making it impossible for them to block you at both ends.</li> <li>Practice Different Scenarios: Like chess, practicing different board setups and scenarios can greatly enhance your strategic thinking and adaptability during the game.</li> </ul> <p>Understanding these strategies and practicing regularly can significantly enhance your gameplay in Connect Four.</p>"},{"location":"make/games/boardgames/chessacre/index.html","title":"Rules","text":"<p>Chessacre is a chess variant in which figures may gain abilities and new figures can be recruited for credits.

In Pash-7, pairs are rewarded. There are 10 points per pair.

It is played with both hands parallel from outside to inside. The last, seventh, and centered jumper determines the point multiplier. It must be announced at the beginning whether the centered bottle is played with the left or the right hand: \"Doppellorer links\" or \"Doppell\u00f6rer rechts\". The point multiplier itself does not count in the score. The other bottle cap points are added and multiplied by the points of the center bottle cap (0-3). E.g. a multiplicator of zero would make this round count zero points.</li> </ul> <p>Passive special moves must be mentioned and able to be traced before points are scored.</p> <ul> <li>Meier (M) is valid in rounds 1-7. The pronunciation of the phrase \"There is still Meier\" asserts the claim to this combination. Meier is valid when a mixture of 1s and 2s (no zero points and no three points) have been played. For example, there can be only one 1 and six 2s. A is a Meier is valid with 21 points. Meier is also valid for a Kniffel. In the case of a double Meier, the point multiplier must also be a 1 or 2. In this case, 21 points are taken times 1 or 2, depending on the multiplier.</li> <li>King move (King) applies in rounds 1-7 and applies in a perfect game where all seven bottle caps give three points each.  With the pronunciation of \"I am king\" this is declared the winner of the game and the game is over. The king move does not apply in Kniffel.

The rule determines how many alive neighbors a cell needs to survive or be born.</p> <p>Details here</p> <p>By configuring these parameters, you can create visually dynamic patterns that evolve frame by frame, producing a captivating visualization within your video:</p> <ul> <li>filename (-f): Specifies a file with the initial grid state, where any non-whitespace character marks an alive cell. If no file is provided, the grid is randomly generated.</li> <li>rate (-r): Sets the frame rate of the output video. Default is 25 fps.</li> <li>size (-s): Defines the resolution of the output video. If a file is used, the size defaults to the file\u2019s dimensions; otherwise, it defaults to 320x240.</li> <li>random_fill_ratio, random_seed: Adjust how the random initial grid is generated.</li> <li>rule: Lets you specify custom survival and birth conditions, either in a textual format (e.g., S23/B3) or as an integer.</li> <li>life_color, death_color, mold_color: Control the appearance of living, dead, and \u201cmoldy\u201d cells.</li> <li>stitch, mold: Add visual or logical effects, such as wrapping grid edges or creating a mold effect for dead cells.</li> </ul> <p>Example:</p> <p>Simple version:</p> <pre><code>ffmpeg -f lavfi -i life=size=640x480:rate=30 -frames:v 300 _ffmpeg_game_of_life1.mp4\n</code></pre> <p>Using colors:</p> <pre><code>ffmpeg -f lavfi -i \"life=s=960x540:mold=10:r=60:ratio=0.1:death_color=#C83232:life_color=#00ff00,scale=960:540:flags=16\" -c:v libx264 -crf 41 -frames:v 1800 -r 60 -t 30 _ffmpeg_game_of_life2.mp4\n</code></pre> <p>The grid represents a two-dimensional layout of cells that evolve over time based on a rule set.

explaintion \u201cSwap-tail\u201d product (base 10) <code>123456789 \u00d7 8 = 987654312</code> Multiplying the ascending digits by 8 yields the descending digits with the last two swapped. Similar patterns hold in other bases (e.g., hex). Base-n reverse trick (exact) <code>sequence \u00d7 (n \u2212 2) + (n \u2212 1) = reverse(sequence)</code> For base <code>n</code>, taking <code>123\u2026(n\u22121)</code> and applying the formula gives <code>\u2026321</code>. Works for n=6\u202616 (and generally). Ratio close to integer (general) <code>N_desc/N_asc = (b \u2212 2) + (b \u2212 1)^3 / (b^b \u2212 b^2 + b \u2212 1)</code> Exact expression for the \u201calmost integer\u201d ratio of descending to ascending digits in base <code>b</code>. The fractional term shrinks ~like <code>1/b^{b\u22123}</code>. Handy approximation <code>N_desc/N_asc \u2248 (b \u2212 2) + (b \u2212 1)^3 / b^b</code> Replace the denominator with <code>b^b</code> for a mental-math approximation; it slightly underestimates the exact value. Decimal special case <code>987654321 / 123456789 = 8 + 729 / 9,999,999,909</code> From the general formula with <code>b=10</code>; the error term is <code>9^3/(10^{10}\u221291) \u2248 7.29\u00d710\u207b\u2078</code>. Hex special case <code>0xFEDCBA987654321 / 0x123456789ABCDEF = 14 + 1/5465701947765793</code> Exact fractional \u201ctail\u201d in base 16; it\u2019s tiny (needs ~52 bits), hence floats round to 14.0. Exact integer \u201cfix\u201d (base 10) <code>(987654321 \u2212 1) / (123456789 + 1) = 8</code> Nudge numerator down 1 and denominator up 1 to make the ratio exactly 8. Works analogously in other bases. Missing-8 series value <code>0.12345679\u2026 = 10/81</code>, <code>0.98765432\u2026 = 80/81</code> The repeating decimals with the \u201c8\u201d omitted equal tidy fractions; follows from geometric-series sums. Geometric/derivative identity <code>\u2211_{k\u22651} kx^k = x/(1\u2212x)^2</code> Used to show <code>0.123456\u2026 = 10/81</code> by plugging <code>x=1/10</code>.

Combined, they form glyphs\u2014compact blocks of code in which multiple strands execute in unison.\n\nExample (Fibonacci program)\n\n```riv\n   \u2575\u2500\u2500\u256e\u2500\u2500\u2500\u256e\u256d\u2500    \u2575\u2575\u256d\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u256e\n    \u2570\u2500\u256f\u2570\u2500\u2500\u256f\u2502       \u2570\u2500\u2576 \u2576\u256e\u2576\u256e\u2576\u256f\n   \u2570\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u256e \u2502      \u256d\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u256f \u2570\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u256e\n         \u2570\u2500\u256f \u2577    \u2570\u2500\u2500\u2500       \u2500\u2500\u2500\u256f\u2577\n\n   \u2575\u2575\u2500\u256e  \u256d\u2500\u256e     \u256d\u2500\u2500       \u2575\u2575\u2570\u2500\u256e  \u2500\u2500\u256e\u2500\u2500\u256e\n      \u2570\u2500\u256e\u2502 \u2570\u2500\u256f \u2575\u2575\u2570\u2500\u256f\u2576\u256e       \u2574\u2500\u256f  \u256d\u2500\u256f\u256d\u2500\u256f\n      \u2570\u2500\u256f\u2570\u2500 \u2570\u2500\u2500\u256f\u2570\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u256f       \u256d\u2574 \u2575\u2576\u256f \u2576\u256f\u2576\u256e\n        \u256d\u2500\u256e \u256d\u2574               \u2502  \u2570\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u256f\n        \u2502 \u2502 \u2502                \u2570\u2500\u256e       \u256d\u2500\u256e \n      \u2502 \u2502 \u2570\u2500\u256f                  \u2502     \u2502   \u2502\n      \u2570\u2500\u256f            \u2577         \u2570\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \u2570\u2500\u2500\u2500\u256f\u2577\n\n   \u2575\u2575 \u256d\u2500\u2500  \u2500\u2500\u256e  \u256d\u2500\u256e         \u2575\u2570\u2500\u256e\n      \u2570\u2500\u256e  \u256d\u2500\u256f\u256d\u2500\u256f \u2502          \u2574\u2500\u256f\n       \u2576\u256f\u2575\u2576\u256f  \u2502 \u2577\u2576\u256f          \u256d\u2500\u256e\n     \u256d\u2500\u256e \u2570\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u256f \u2502   \u256d\u2500\u256e        \u2502\n     \u2502 \u2570\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u256e \u256d\u2500\u256f \u256d\u2574\u2502 \u2502      \u256d\u2500\u256f\n     \u2570\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u256e \u2502 \u2502 \u2502 \u2502 \u2502 \u2502      \u2502\n     \u256d\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u256f \u2502 \u2502 \u2570\u2500\u256f \u2502 \u2577      \u2570\u2500\u2577\n     \u2570\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u256e \u2502 \u2570\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u256f \u2502  \n          \u2502 \u2570\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u256f\u2577\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"tech/art/random/scene.html","title":"The Scene","text":"<p>Videos:</p> <p>BBS the Documentary</p> <ul> <li>00:00 Episode 1.

(see also CBM-ASCII or PET-ASCII). This set extends the 1963 version of ASCII, incorporating graphical symbols alongside standard alphanumeric characters. These graphical symbols enabled users to create simple, character-based graphics, facilitating game development and enhancing the visual capabilities of Commodore computers. The character set operates in two modes:\u200b</p> <ul> <li>Unshifted Mode: Includes uppercase letters and a variety of graphical symbols.\u200b</li> <li>Shifted Mode: Provides both uppercase and lowercase letters, with some graphical symbols replaced by lowercase characters.\u200b</li> </ul> <p>Users can toggle between these modes to access the desired set of characters. Additionally, PETSCII includes control characters that manage cursor movement and screen functions, such as clearing the screen or returning the cursor to the home position, allowing for dynamic text and graphics manipulation within programs. The inclusion of graphical symbols in PETSCII facilitated the creation of blocky, pixelated images, leading to a unique art form known as PETSCII art, showcasing the creative potential of character-based graphics on Commodore computers.</p>"},{"location":"tech/art/text/PETSCII.html#editors","title":"Editors","text":"<p>Search for \"PETSCII Editor\".

Punycode encodes non-ASCII characters, such as emojis or accented letters, into a format that DNS can process. For example, when a user enters a domain like \ud83c\udf55.ws, the browser converts it to its Punycode form (xn--vi8h.ws) before making any DNS queries.

It is a 7-bit standard that defines letters, numbers, and basic symbols (@, #, /). The Art Style: \"ASCII Art\" usually refers to pictures made only using these standard keyboard characters. The Limitation: You can't draw solid boxes or seamless lines because standard ASCII doesn't contain those shapes.</p> </li> <li> <p>ANSI (The Styling) ANSI usually refers to escape codes used to control the terminal. It tells the computer \"make this text red\" or \"move the cursor to row 10.\" The Art Style: \"ANSI Art\" (popular in the BBS era) uses specific block characters (like \u2588, \u2580, \u2584) combined with coloring codes. The Problem: ANSI art relies on the computer using a specific \"Code Page\" (usually CP437). If you view an old ANSI art file in a modern Unicode terminal without the right font, the boxes might break, or the line-drawing characters might turn into question marks.</p> </li> <li> <p>Unscii (The Visual Bridge) Unscii is the font that solves the rendering problem. It takes those specific block characters used in ANSI art, old Commodore 64 (PETSCII) graphics, and Teletext, and maps them to modern Unicode locations. In short: Unscii ensures that the specific pixel patterns of the past render correctly on modern operating systems.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"tech/cloud/index.html","title":"Cloud Overview","text":"Category AWS Azure GCP Identity and Access Management (IAM) IAM, IAM Identity Center, Roles Azure AD, RBAC, ARM IAM, Service Accounts, Resource Hierarchy Compute EC2, Lambda, Elastic Beanstalk, Lightsail Virtual Machines, Azure Functions, Azure App Service, Azure Batch Compute Engine, Cloud Functions, App Engine, GKE Storage S3, EBS, EFS, Glacier Azure Blob Storage, Azure Disk Storage, Azure Files, Azure Archive Storage Cloud Storage, Persistent Disks, Filestore, Archive Storage Database RDS, DynamoDB, Redshift, Aurora Azure SQL Database, Cosmos DB, Azure Database for MySQL/PostgreSQL/MariaDB, Synapse Analytics Cloud SQL, Bigtable, Firestore, BigQuery AI and Machine Learning SageMaker, Rekognition, Comprehend, Polly Azure Machine Learning, Cognitive Services, Bot Service, Synapse Analytics AI Platform, Vision AI, Natural Language AI, Dialogflow DevOps and Monitoring CodePipeline, CloudWatch, CodeDeploy, CloudFormation Azure DevOps, Azure Monitor, ARM Templates, Azure Automation Cloud Build, Operations Suite, Deployment Manager, Cloud Scheduler Security and Identity IAM, AWS Shield, AWS WAF, GuardDuty Azure AD, Azure Security Center, Azure DDoS Protection, Azure Sentinel IAM, Cloud Armor, Security Command Center, Chronicle Analytics and Big Data EMR, Athena, Kinesis, QuickSight Azure Synapse Analytics, HDInsight, Data Lake Analytics, Power BI BigQuery, Dataflow, Dataproc, Looker Management and Governance AWS Organizations, AWS Config, AWS Control Tower, CloudTrail Azure Policy, Azure Blueprints, Cost Management and Billing, Management Groups Resource Manager, Cloud Asset Inventory, Billing Reports and Budgets, Organization Policies Containers and Orchestration ECS, EKS, Fargate, App Runner AKS, ACI, Azure Service Fabric, Azure Container Apps GKE, Cloud Run, Anthos, Container Registry Content Delivery and Networking CloudFront, Route 53, Global Accelerator, Direct Connect Azure CDN, Azure DNS, Traffic Manager, ExpressRoute Cloud CDN, Cloud DNS, Cloud Interconnect, Traffic Director Developer Tools CodeCommit, CodeBuild, CodePipeline, Cloud9 Visual Studio App Center, DevTest Labs, Azure Repos, Azure Pipelines Cloud Source Repositories, Cloud Build, Cloud Code, Cloud Functions IoT (Internet of Things) AWS IoT Core, IoT Greengrass, IoT Analytics, IoT Device Defender Azure IoT Hub, IoT Edge, Digital Twins, Azure Sphere Cloud IoT Core, Edge TPU, Cloud IoT Edge, Firebase Migration and Transfer Migration Hub, DataSync, Snowball, Database Migration Service (DMS) Azure Migrate, Site Recovery, Data Box, Database Migration Service Cloud Migration Tools, Transfer Appliance, Migrate for Compute Engine, Database Migration Service Hybrid and Multi-cloud AWS Outposts, Local Zones, Wavelength Azure Arc, Azure Stack, Azure VMware Solution Anthos, Google Distributed Cloud, Bare Metal Solution Communication Services Amazon Chime, Amazon Connect, SNS Azure Communication Services, Notification Hubs, Bot Service Dialogflow, Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) Blockchain Managed Blockchain, QLDB Azure Blockchain Service, Blockchain Workbench Blockchain on GCP, BigQuery Public Datasets for Blockchain Game Development GameLift, Lumberyard PlayFab, Azure Gaming VM OpenCue, Agones"},{"location":"tech/cloud/aws/index.html","title":"Amazon Web Services","text":"<p>Terraform Generator: https://terragen.dev/</p>"},{"location":"tech/cloud/aws/index.html#aws-powershell-module","title":"AWS PowerShell Module","text":"<p>AWS Tools for PowerShell</p> <p>Windows</p> <pre><code>Install-Module -Name AWS.Tools.Installer\nInstall-AWSToolsModule AWS.Tools.EC2,AWS.Tools.S3 -CleanUp\n</code></pre> <p>Linux</p> <pre><code>Install-Module -Name AWSPowerShell.NetCore\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"tech/cloud/aws/index.html#public-ips","title":"Public IPs","text":"<p>A JSON file for all public AWS IP ranges is avaiable for download.</p> <p>Example Output</p> <pre><code>{\n  \"syncToken\": \"1648221200\",\n  \"createDate\": \"2022-03-25-15-13-20\",\n  \"prefixes\": [\n    {\n      \"ip_prefix\": \"3.5.140.0/22\",\n      \"region\": \"ap-northeast-2\",\n      \"service\": \"AMAZON\",\n      \"network_border_group\": \"ap-northeast-2\"\n    }\n    ]\n}\n</code></pre> <p>It is also possible to query the public IP ranges with the AWS PowerShell module:</p> <pre><code>Get-AWSPublicIpAddressRange -ServiceKey ec2 -Region  eu-west-1,eu-central-1\n</code></pre> <p>Example Output</p> <pre><code>IpPrefix           : 54.247.0.0/16\nIpAddressFormat    : Ipv4\nRegion             : eu-west-1\nService            : EC2\nNetworkBorderGroup : eu-west-1\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"tech/cloud/aws/index.html#regions","title":"Regions","text":"AWS Region Code AWS Region Name Comment us-east-1 US East (N.

regions, that preserves data residency and compliance boundaries.</li> <li>An Azure region has a discrete pricing and service availability and is a set of data centers, deployed within a latency-defined perimeter and connected through a dedicated regional low-latency network.</li> <li>Azure data centers are unique physical buildings located all over the globe that house a group of

Firstly, it significantly reduces the time required to set up infrastructure, enabling faster deployment of applications and services. Secondly, IaC ensures consistency across environments, making them identical and reproducible, which minimizes discrepancies between development, testing, and production stages.

This adds complexity at the beginning of the project, but allows easier adding of new microservices. The Unified Namespace represents a robust event-driven architecture that facilitates seamless communication among network nodes. It operates on the fundamental principle that all data, irrespective of immediate consumer demand, should be published and readily accessible for consumption. As a result, any node within the network can function as either a producer or a consumer, adapting to the system's requirements at any given moment. Unified Namespace typically harnesses MQTT or Apache Kafka as a central message broker, designed with a focus on high scalability and effortless node integration within the network. This stands in sharp contrast to Industry 3.0 architectures, which often exhibit a more linear data flow and limited connectivity flexibility.</p> <p></p> <p>There are three key imperatives for an IT/OT architecture, underscoring the imperative of amalgamating best practices from both domains:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Reliability centers on ensuring faultless system functionality, even in the face of disruptions. It encompasses addressing hardware glitches, such as equipment failures, software issues like bugs or resource constraints, and human errors resulting from improper system usage. Strategies for mitigation encompass employing dependable hardware, introducing redundancy, continuous software monitoring, and implementing self-healing mechanisms.</p> </li> <li> <p>Scalability spotlights the system's capacity to accommodate heightened workloads, including the incorporation of additional data sources for machine learning models.

The purpose of these lines is multifaceted:</p> <ul> <li>Priming the Nozzle: It helps in priming the nozzle, ensuring that the filament is flowing smoothly before the actual object begins to print. This is especially important if the printer has been idle for some time or if it's the first print of the day.</li> <li>Adhesion and Warping Prevention: For a 'brim', which is similar to a skirt but attaches to the edges of the print, it increases the surface area of the first layer, improving bed adhesion. This is particularly useful for materials prone to warping or for prints with small footprints on the build plate.</li> <li>Leveling and Calibration Check: These initial lines can also act as a last-minute check for bed leveling. If the skirt is not laying down properly, it's an indication that the bed might need to be re-leveled.</li> <li>Cleaning: It can also help in cleaning any residual or burnt filament from the nozzle, ensuring a cleaner start to the print.</li> <li>Temperature Stabilization: It allows the printer to stabilize its temperature, particularly for the print bed and the extruder, ensuring a consistent environment for the print.</li> </ul> <p>Setting in Cura:</p> <p></p> <p>Different Setting options:</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"tech/hardware/maker-tools/cnc.html","title":"CNC","text":""},{"location":"tech/hardware/maker-tools/cnc.html#getting-started-hafven-cnc","title":"Getting Started Hafven CNC","text":"<ul> <li> <p> Alles anschalten nach der Reihenfolge Beschriftung (Reminder: Karte besorgen [Schritt 5])</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p> Rechner starten und in LinuxCNC Referenzfahrt durchf\u00fchren</p> <p></p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p> Opferplatte auflegen und Werkst\u00fcck einspannen</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p> Tastplatte auflegen und Messwerkzeug einspannen (Werkzeug 99)</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p> Programm XYZ Tastplatte laufen lassen</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p> NGC Datei laden (auf M6 T1 achten und Anleitung folgen)</p> </li> <li> <p> Notaus im Blick behalten :D</p> <p></p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"tech/hardware/maker-tools/cnc.html#estlcam","title":"EstlCAM","text":"<p>Link: https://www.estlcam.de/</p> <p>Vorbereitung f\u00fcr Hafven:</p> <ul> <li> In Estlcam unter Einstellungen/Grundeinstellungen LinuxCNC als CNC-Programm ausw\u00e4hlen.</li> <li> Unter Einstellungen/CNC Programme auf \"Einstellungen \u00f6ffnen\" klicken.</li> <li> CNC-Programm Voreinstellungen bzw.

Here are some steps you can take:</p> <ol> <li>Persistent Wi-Fi Connection:</li> <li>WPA_Supplicant: Ensure your <code>/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf</code> is correctly set up. This is the primary configuration file for Wi-Fi.</li> <li> <p>Auto-Reconnect Script: Create a script that checks the Wi-Fi connection periodically and tries to reconnect if the connection is lost.      <pre><code>#!/bin/bash\nwhile true; do\n  if ! ping -c 1 google.com; then\n    sudo ifdown wlan0 &amp;&amp; sudo ifup wlan0\n  fi\n  sleep 60\ndone\n</code></pre>      Save the script, make it executable with <code>chmod +x script_name.sh</code>, and consider adding it to your crontab or systemd to run on boot.</p> </li> <li> <p>Persistent Bluetooth Connection:</p> </li> <li>Bluetoothctl: Use <code>bluetoothctl</code> to pair and trust devices. Once a device is trusted, it will attempt to auto-reconnect.</li> <li> <p>Auto-Reconnect Script: Similar to Wi-Fi, you can create a script that checks the Bluetooth connection and tries to reconnect if it's lost. This might be a bit more complex, depending on the Bluetooth service you're using (like BlueZ).</p> </li> <li> <p>Network Manager:</p> </li> <li> <p>Consider using a more robust network manager like <code>NetworkManager</code> or <code>ConnMan</code>. These tools often handle reconnections better than the default setup.</p> </li> <li> <p>External Watchdog:</p> </li> <li> <p>Some advanced users employ an external hardware watchdog. This is a separate piece of hardware that monitors the Raspberry Pi and can reset it if it detects a failure. This is a more extreme solution and is typically used in scenarios where the Raspberry Pi must remain operational.</p> </li> <li> <p>External Antenna:</p> </li> <li> <p>If you're experiencing connection drops due to weak signals, consider using a Raspberry Pi variant or a Wi-Fi/Bluetooth dongle that supports external antennas. An external antenna can significantly improve connection stability.</p> </li> <li> <p>Regular Updates:</p> </li> <li> <p>Ensure your Raspberry Pi's OS and packages are regularly updated. Updates often contain bug fixes and improvements for hardware drivers, including Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.</p> </li> <li> <p>Logs and Monitoring:</p> </li> <li>Regularly check system logs for any Wi-Fi or Bluetooth-related errors. The <code>dmesg</code> and <code>journalctl</code> commands can be useful.</li> <li> <p>Consider setting up monitoring tools like <code>iftop</code>, <code>nmon</code>, or <code>bmon</code> to keep an eye on network activities.</p> </li> <li> <p>Static IP:</p> </li> <li> <p>Assigning a static IP to your Raspberry Pi can sometimes help in scenarios where the DHCP server is causing connectivity issues.</p> </li> <li> <p>Power Supply:</p> </li> <li>Ensure you're using a reliable power supply. Insufficient power can cause a myriad of issues, including unstable network connections.</li> </ol> <p>Remember, the key to resilience is redundancy and regular monitoring.

Files and folders you want other people to see. <code>-rwxrwxrwx</code> 777 No restriction, global WRX any user can do anything. Files and folders you want other people to see and modify. The most open permission. <p>Permissions on directory have the following meaning: The read bit allows to list the files within the directory. The write bit allows to create, rename, or delete files within the directory, and modify the directory's attributes. The execute bit allows to enter the directory, and access files and directories inside.  </p> <p>To view permissions as numerical code: <code>stat -c %a &lt;filename&gt;</code>.</p> <p>What does <code>s</code> mean? (click to expand) \"s\", like \"x\", means something different for directories and regular files.</p> <p>For files, \"x\" means \"executable\" of course. For directories, it means \"searchable.\" Without \"x\" permission on a directory, you can't set it to be your current directory, or get any of the file information like size, permissions, or inode number, so that you effectively can't access any of the files. If a directory has no \"r\" permission, you can't get a listing, but if you know a file is there, you can still access the file.</p> <p>Now \"s\", for files, means \"setuid exec.\" If a file has s permission, then it's executable, and furthermore, the user id and/or group id of the process is set to the user or group id of the owner of the file, depending on whether it's the user or group \"s\" that's set. This is a way to give limited root powers to a user -- a program that runs as root when an ordinary user executes it. For example, the \"passwd\" program, which can change otherwise write-protected files on behalf of a user, works this way: it's owned by the \"bin\" group (generally) and has g+s so that it can write to /etc/passwd and/or /etc/opasswd which are also owned by group \"bin.\"</p> <p>For directories, \"s\" means \"sticky\". If a directory has \"s\", then the owner and/or group of any files put into the directory are set to the owner/group of the directory. This is often used on CVS repositories, so that the files in the repository end up all owned by the same person and/or group, even though they're put in by different people.

Here are some examples:</p> <ul> <li>Master/Slave: As mentioned earlier, this terminology, especially in database contexts, has been replaced in many instances with terms like \"Primary/Replica\" or \"Leader/Follower\".</li> <li>Blacklist/Whitelist: These terms are being replaced with more neutral terms like \"Blocklist/Allowlist\" or \"Denylist/Permitlist\".</li> <li>Dummy Value: The term \"dummy\" can be considered derogatory. Alternatives like \"placeholder value\" or \"sample value\" are used instead.</li> <li>Sanity Check: This term can be seen as insensitive to mental health issues. Alternatives include \"Quick Check\", \"Confidence Check\", or \"Coherence Check\".</li> <li>Kill: Commands or processes in computing that use the term \"kill\" (e.g., kill command in Unix-like systems) can be seen as violent. Some suggest using terms like \"stop\", \"end\", or \"terminate\", though \"kill\" is still widely used due to its historical presence.</li> <li>Male/Female Connectors: In electronics, connectors are often referred to as \"male\" or \"female\" based on their design. Some people are moving towards terms like \"plug\" and \"socket\" or \"pin\" and \"jack\" to avoid gendered language.</li> <li>Grandfathered: This term, which means to exempt existing entities from new rules, has racial origins related to voting rights in the U.S. Alternatives include \"legacy status\" or \"exempt from new rules\".</li> <li>Man-in-the-Middle Attack: This cybersecurity term describes an attack where a malicious actor intercepts communication between two parties. Some suggest using \"On-path Attack\" or \"Person-in-the-Middle Attack\" as alternatives.</li> <li>Blind Carbon Copy (BCC): Some argue that the term \"blind\" in this context can be seen as insensitive. Alternatives like \"Private Copy\" or simply \"BCC\" without expanding the acronym are sometimes used.</li> <li>Crippleware: This term was used to describe software that has some of its features disabled until a payment or license is provided. Given the derogatory nature of the term \"cripple\", alternatives like \"Feature-limited\", \"Demo Version\", or \"Restricted Version\" are preferred.</li> <li>Manned/Unmanned: In the context of space exploration or drones, the terms \"manned\" and \"unmanned\" are being replaced with \"crewed\" and \"uncrewed\" to avoid gender-specific language.</li> <li>Native Functionality: The term \"native\" can be seen as problematic when used to describe inherent features or functions of software or hardware. Alternatives like \"built-in functionality\" or \"inherent features\" are suggested.</li> <li>First-Class Citizen: In programming, this term is used to describe entities that have all rights and privileges. To avoid potential classist connotations, terms like \"First-Class Entity\" or \"First-Class Object\" are used.</li> <li>He/She, Him/Her in Documentation: Many documentation and style guides now recommend using gender-neutral pronouns like \"they\" and \"them\" when the gender of the subject is unknown or irrelevant.</li> <li>Chained Promises: In programming, especially with JavaScript promises, the term \"chaining\" can have negative connotations related to slavery. Some developers prefer terms like \"linked promises\" or simply \"using promises sequentially\".</li> <li>Black Hat/White Hat: In cybersecurity, these terms refer to malicious and ethical hackers, respectively. While still widely used, there's some discussion about finding more neutral terminology.</li> <li>Motherboard/Fatherboard: The main circuit board in a computer is commonly called a \"motherboard\". While \"fatherboard\" isn't a standard term, the gendered nature of \"motherboard\" has been discussed. However, alternatives haven't been widely adopted.</li> <li>Suicide Command: In computing, a command that can cause a system to become inoperable is sometimes colloquially referred to as a \"suicide command\". Given the sensitivity around the topic of suicide, it's recommended to use terms like \"destructive command\" or \"dangerous command\".</li> <li>Dead Man's Switch: This term refers to a switch that is automatically operated if the human operator becomes incapacitated. Alternatives like \"automatic safety switch\" or \"life-check switch\" can be considered.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"tech/standards/IT-Humor.html#programming","title":"PROgramming","text":""},{"location":"tech/standards/IT-Humor.html#assembler-mnemonics","title":"Assembler Mnemonics","text":"<p>Secret undocumented instructions:</p> <pre><code>ARG: Agree to Run Garbage\nBDM: Branch and Destroy Memory\nCMN: Convert to Mayan Numerals\nDDS: Damage Disk and Stop\nEMR: Emit Microwave Radiation\nETO: Emulate Toaster Oven\nFSE: Fake Serious Error\nGSI: Garble Subsequent Instructions\nGQS: Go Quarter Speed\nHEM: Hide Evidence of Malfunction\nIDD: Inhale Dust and Die\nIKI: Ignore Keyboard Input\nIMU: Irradiate and Mutate User\nJPF: Jam Paper Feed\nJUM: Jeer at Users Mistake\nKFP: Kindle Fire in Printer\nLNM: Launch Nuclear Missiles\nMAW: Make Aggravating Whine\nNNI: Neglect Next Instruction\nOBU: Overheat and Burn if Unattended\nPNG: Pass Noxious Gas\nQWF: Quit Working Forever\nQVC: Question Valid Command\nRWD: Read Wrong Device\nSCE: Simulate Correct Execution\nSDJ: Send Data to Japan\nTTC: Tangle Tape and Crash\nUBC: Use Bad Chip\nVDP: Violate Design Parameters\nVMB: Verify and Make Bad\nWAF: Warn After Fact\nXID: eXchange Instruction with Data\nYII: Yield to Irresistible Impulse\nZAM: Zero All Memory\nPI: Punch Invalid\nPOPI: Punch Operator Immediately\nRASC: Read And Shred Card\nRPM: Read Programmers Mind\nRSSC: Reduce Speed, Step Carefully (for improved accuracy)\nRTAB: Rewind Tape and Break\nRWDSK: ReWind DiSK\nSPSW: Scramble Program Status Word\nSRSD: Seek Record and Scar Disk\nWBT: Water Binary Tree\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"tech/standards/IT-Humor.html#wtf-driven-development","title":"WTF Driven development","text":"<p>A list of management systems. This list was created by Google Driven Development.</p> <ul> <li>Asshole-Driven development (ADD): Any team where the biggest jerk makes all the big decisions is asshole driven development. All wisdom, logic or process goes out the window when Mr. Asshole is in the room, doing whatever idiotic, selfish thing he thinks is best. There may rules and processes, but Mr. Asshole breaks them and people follow anyway. Likely driven by a culture that makes it impossible to change or make decisions. People who want to make things better are forced to be an asshole about it because if they don't then they are not heard. Not everyone makes great decisions and I bet you ever single asshole is doing what they honestly believe is best.</li> <li>Cognitive Dissonance development (CDD): In any organization where there are two or more divergent beliefs on how software should be made. The tension between those beliefs, as it\u2019s fought out in various meetings and individual decisions by players on both sides, defines the project more than any individual belief itself. Likely evolves from an organization that punishes rocking the boat. Rather than spending your time changing and make a decision on how to improve you end up needing to focus on how to make that change without causing trouble. Disagreement is fine - an organization that punishes for disagreement just ends up forcing everyone involved to focus on how to get their way without showing active disagreement.</li> <li>Cover Your Ass Engineering (CYAE): The driving force behind most individual efforts is to make sure than when the shit hits the fan, they are not to blame. Ignore your engineers and their suggestions, then punish them when what you did anyway didn't work, and you have CYAE. Plenty of consultants have learned this one: \"I recommend against this but it's your choice and the consequences will be on you when I'm gone\".</li> <li>Development By Denial (DBD): Everybody pretends there is a method for what\u2019s being done, and that things are going ok, when in reality, things are a mess and the process is on the floor. The worse things get, the more people depend on their denial of what\u2019s really happening, or their isolation in their own small part of the project, to survive. Hire managers that don't manage if you want this environment. No one makes decisions, engineering team isn't given the time to find their own process, so they just do their best with what they have. If you want to strengthen this then I suggest yelling at your engineers whenever you find there isn't a process in place and immediately follow it up with enough engineering work that they will be working 60 hour work weeks.</li> <li>Get Me Promoted Methodology (GMPM): People write code and design things to increase their visibility, satisfy their boss\u2019s whims, and accelerate their path to a raise or the corner office no matter how far outside of stated goals their efforts go. This includes allowing disasters to happen so people can be heroes, writing hacks that look great in the short term but crumble after the individual has moved on, and focusing more on the surface of work than its value. This is an easy environment to create. Just don't recognize ANYONE who seems to consistently do a good job and never has a disaster. If you have someone who generates good work and never seems to need to fire fight then they clearly are just doing the minimum and not doing such a good job that the firefight isn't necessary.</li> <li>Don\u2019t Rock The Boat Development (DRTBD): Satisfies all those senior developers that are looking forward to retirement and don\u2019t want to develop on anything that was not tried and proved during the 90\u2019s, the decade in which their latest mindset update took place.</li> <li>Hormone Driven Development (HDD): Development done by some young guys who think they know it all (evident by posts like that from the little tyke OldCoot). These HDD kids lack social skills and tend to write convoluted, over engineered code hoping to impress everybody (even the old guys they despise). Instead of taking advantage of being mentored by older developers who have been writing code since these young dummies were still in their mother\u2019s ovaries, they are arrogant self-promoting, blowhards who are TOO STUPID to know they suck as a developers. They are too immature to understand that the older guys have met and overcome challenges in their careers unknown and unfathomable to these young maggots. Sometimes these young \u2018uns are even promoted into an ADD position for a short term until they fail and are removed. Go ahead now kids \u2013 think of something clever and condescending to write in a reply now.</li> <li>Fear Based Development (FBD): Nothing ever changes because every decision that might make things better is instantly poo-pooed by senior developers who all cite the same apocryphal story from the nineties about how they tried that and it is expensive and doesn\u2019t work regardless of how far the rest of the software industry has come with the technology or tools since then. FBD Real world example #1: when considering upgrading to git (from dimensions) the idea that git could do automatic merges of any kind was literally and loudly laughed at. FBD Real World Example #2: when considering doing any level of automated testing anywhere in the building an apocryphal story from the nineties is always cited as other senior developers get nostalgic and nod and the idea dies a quick and painless death.</li> <li>Error Driven Development (EDD): Cubicle dwellers are constantly putting out fires, chasing bugs, fixing bugs, debugging, patching bad code, breaking data type interfaces, all because of short-sighted managers who love golf more than software quality. Combined with silly rules like \"be here by 8am\" regardless of 60 hour weeks and saturdays/sundays. EDD mimics natural control systems found in nature.</li> <li>Hacker driven development (HDD): It is important to do it, no matter how you did it. Any type of constraints, weather from a language, design or methodology is refused. If it is not performing well, throw more hardware at it. And of course the less lines of code you use the better, specially of you are using a cool feature from your scripting language the does some sort of magic, regardless of the fact that you are the only one who understand this code, and even you will not understand this code when you read it 3 month from the day you wrote it.</li> <li>Smothering Hen Driven Development (SMDD): An addendum to ADD, where the asshole smothers you by sitting beside you all day like a hen does with her eggs and suggests a plethora of ideas that will render maximum counter-productivity and clobber any progress back to the stone age. This methodology is further supplemented by CTRL+Z Driven Development, when you follow the asshole\u2019s advice but scraps it after spending much time, effort, and personal life once the client finds out you did something outrageously not in the design. \u2013 Reward Incompetence Punish Success (RIPS): In an ADD-driven environment, the most incompetent get rewarded by the more incompetent, for being members of the same \u2018Stupid Club\u2019. The successful, competent developers are punished for making the incompetent managers and their little kiss-asses look bad. Their goal is to force the competence out so the incompetents can continue unexposed and unchallenged. They follow the AABC rule\u2013\u2018A\u2019 people hire \u2018A\u2019 people while \u2018B\u2019 people hire \u2018C\u2019 people. Eventually there are only \u2018C\u2019 developers being lead by \u2018B\u2019 or \u2018C\u2019 managers.</li> <li>Soviet Union Factory methodology (SUF): Documentation is not existent, one dev doesn\u2019t know what other one is doing or what an overall project should do. Given small and specific tasks they stumble in the code blindly. Communication is kept to zero. Code is full of methods who perform exact same function. Patterns are either non existent or there\u2019s as much of them as there\u2019s developers rendering any effort to keep structure clean useless. Management thinks project is too big to fail</li> <li>Sales-Idiot Driven Development (SIDD) Where, in flagrant violation of the correct procedures, a maverick sales-droid has sold something that doesn\u2019t exist, probably can\u2019t exist, or would take an eternity to make exist, it\u2019s the company\u2019s BIGGEST BREAK EVER, and must be done next week to exacting specifications already agreed with the customer. By the sales-droid. Alone. Given the deal value, the CEO\u2019s reluctantly had to support it. Off you go, then. Fully working prototype by \u2013 um \u2013 Thursday work for you? (BTW, most sales-folk know to discuss and negotiate with Engineering before making commitments. These fine, upstanding and honorable people never come onto developers\u2019 radars. Sadly the small minority that are SalesIdiots do, and give the whole profession \u2013 which pays everyone\u2019s wages \u2013 a bad name.)</li> <li>Innovation-Driven Development (IDD): Everything you ever knew \u2013 everything you read about only last week as the Next Big Thing \u2013 is sooo yesterday. We\u2019re going to refactor the project to use Gurgle.js and the Glorp framework. Yes, I know, it\u2019s only two weeks to release. Yes, I know, Gurgle\u2019s in first alpha, and Glorp\u2019s on early preview. But we can do this, people!</li> <li>Wheel-Reinvention-Driven Development (WRIDD): MySQL can\u2019t hack it, and doesn\u2019t support an obscure feature that we probably don\u2019t need anyway. PostgreSQL had a bug in the last release. So. We\u2019re going to write our own database, because we can do in two weeks what Oracle, MySQL/MariaDB and PostgreSQL couldn\u2019t manage in a decade or three.</li> <li>Golf Driven Development (GDD): Chief Exec plays a few holes with big cheese at prospective client company, during which big cheese hints at a sale if a certain feature exists. Chief Exec responds \"what a coincidence: that\u2019s in our next release!\" and seals the deal. Dev team then has to implement it by yesterday, with the added bonus that they can\u2019t ask the prospective client to clarify exactly what they wanted the feature to do because as far as he\u2019s concerned it\u2019s already implemented.</li> <li>Kick The Can Development (KTCD): All important design and architecture decisions are delayed to finish a couple \"critical\" features in the next two weeks. In two weeks, six more features will be deemed \"critical\" and four more weeks added to project, but still no time for design or architecture. Continue process for the next 2 years, then scrap the steaming mess for a new technology that promises to rewrite the entire project in just 6 weeks. Repeat process with new technology.</li> <li>Despair Driven Development (DDD): It\u2019s clear the project/company is going to fail anyway, so hack on anything you want, it doesn\u2019t really matter.</li> <li>I\u2019m Gone Anyway Methodology (IGAM): Where you know that you\u2019ll leave the company by the end of the month and don\u2019t care about anything.</li> <li>Ayn Rand Driven Development (ARDD): Every class does only what\u2019s best for itself with no thought or concern given to any other class, any objects created are held on to privately forever and any object that needs something is considered a parasite.</li> <li>Timecard driven development (TDD): Hack for a while. commit at 4 PM. you may not be able to separate features, but you can back code out to the most recent \"runs\" commit before the rollback you need!</li> <li>seagull management (SM) Where the supposed leaders are totally uninvolved in the work, they just swoop down once in a while to shit all over everything \"This is wrong, and this, and this looks bad\" etc, before flying away again. Then  just swoop in, yell \"MINE\" and take credit for all your hard work.</li> <li>Demo Driven Development (DDD): Requirements appear in a flash because managers bragged about something their people do or sales guys talked about a nonexistent feature, and now you have to make reality fit theirs. Soon enough you'll realize that you haven't made anything substantial because all your time was spent on spike projects and management will wonder where all their features are in production. They will view it as the project running out of control and micromanage more to \"fix\" the problem.</li> <li>Bug Driven Development (BDD): You know your code is going to have bugs so you should always write bugs first. That way you can find and fix them earlier in the process and for the remainder of the dev cycle just write bug free code.</li> <li>Interrupt Driven Development (IDD): Where a ridiculously large number of people in the company have the authority to order you to drop whatever you're doing and work on whatever they've just decided absolutely has to be done right now. The result is that nothing gets done because everything gets interrupted.</li> <li>Google Driven Development (GDD): This person does not believe in writing anything on his own, copy/paste from blogs, articles, source code is a way of life. And since I have not written it I don't care how it works as long as I see something working. His best friends are Ctrl-C, Ctrl-V and Google. Cannot write 5 lines of code or code for 5 minutes without doing a Google search. His productivity is directly related to performance of corporate network, and how fast Google searches. If the network is down, it's better to go for a coffee. Search hours on Google for \"Object reference not set to an instance of an object\" and then believes that the whole world is facing the same issue. Who cares what the context of problem is. He then tries each and every solution that Google GOD provides. If by fluke he is able to fix or camouflage the issue, he considers himself something special, but in his heart he knows he has no clue what happened. Thanks Google for saving his day and continues his pursuit to become a better GDDer. If not, then it's time for the Lead, the next GOD in Line. The Lead should be able to fix this issue, What else are Leads there for :)</li> </ul>"},{"location":"tech/standards/ai.html","title":"AI","text":""},{"location":"tech/standards/ai.html#terms","title":"Terms","text":""},{"location":"tech/standards/ai.html#principiles","title":"Principiles","text":"<p>There are six principles of responsible AI:</p> <ul> <li>Fairness: Fairness focuses on preventing bias and ensuring equitable treatment for all individuals.

Most efficient.</li> <li>Alphanumeric mode: Digits, uppercase English letters, and a few symbols (space, $, %, *, +, -, ., /, :).</li> <li>Byte mode: Binary data (8-bit bytes, e.g., UTF-8 text).</li> <li>Kanji mode: Japanese characters (Shift JIS encoding).</li> <li>ECI mode: Extended Channel Interpretation (for character set switching).</li> </ul> <p>QR codes can restore lost or corrupted data via Reed-Solomon codes. There are four levels:</p> <ul> <li>L (Low): ~7% of codewords can be restored.</li> <li>M (Medium): ~15% restored.</li> <li>Q (Quartile): ~25% restored.</li> <li>H (High): ~30% restored.</li> </ul> <p>QR codes have 40 versions: Version 1 is a 21x21 matrix. Each increment in version adds 4 modules per side. Version 40 is a 177x177 matrix.</p> <p>Data capacity depends on version, error correction level, and encoding mode. For example, Version 40, Low ECC can encode up to:</p> <ul> <li>Numeric: 7,089 characters</li> <li>Alphanumeric: 4,296 characters</li> <li>Byte: 2,953 bytes</li> <li>Kanji: 1,817 characters</li> </ul>

And of course administrative regions come and go with changes to local government structures - for example, the county I was born in no longer exists.isfy two out of the three properties of being decentralized, secure, and me- All right, but surely people's names are diverse enough such that no million people share the same name.ningful. These properties are desirable in large, public namespaces and are defined as follows:</p> <ul> <li>Decentralized: There is no central authority issuing names or deciding their validity. Instead, the namespace is managed by multiple authorities who do not fully trust each other. The key criterion is the absence of a hierarchical trust relationship, allowing for arbitrarily constructed trust networks.</li> <li>Secure: The integrity of name mappings is maintained, meaning that an attacker cannot manipulate a mapping without the attempt being detected. Security ensures that the connections between names and addresses or other values remain unaltered and trustworthy.</li> <li>Meaningful: A name's meaningfulness means it is human-readable and a person can derive significance from it. Meaningful names are user-chosen and comprehensible, as opposed to automatically generated, seemingly random strings.</li> </ul> <p>The theory asserts that it is impossible to fully achieve all three properties simultaneously in a namespace. Therefore, only two of these properties can be optimized at the same time. For example:</p> <ul> <li>A system might be decentralized and secure, but the names might not be meaningful (e.g., cryptographic hashes).</li> <li>A system might be decentralized and meaningful, but it may lack security (e.g., a peer-to-peer network with user-defined names but inadequate security measures).</li> <li>A system might be secure and meaningful, but it would be centralized (e.g., a centrally managed domain name system where a central authority issues and manages names).</li> </ul> <p>The challenge lies in finding practical solutions that offer a balanced compromise between these three properties.</p>"},{"location":"tech/standards/names.html#falsehoods","title":"Falsehoods","text":""},{"location":"tech/standards/names.html#addresses","title":"Addresses","text":""},{"location":"tech/standards/names.html#incorrect-assumptions-on-addresses","title":"Incorrect assumptions on addresses","text":"<p>Addressing is a fertile ground for incorrect assumptions, because everyone\u2019s used to dealing with addresses and 99% of the time they seem so simple. Below are some incorrect assumptions:</p> <ul> <li>An address will start with, or at least include, a building number. Counterexample: Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, London, WC2E 9DD, United Kingdom.</li> <li>When there is a building number, it will be all-numeric. Counterexample: 1A Egmont Road, Middlesbrough, TS4 2HT 4-5 Bonhill Street, London, EC2A 4BX</li> <li>No buildings are numbered zero Counterexample: 0 Egmont Road, Middlesbrough, TS4 2HT</li> <li>Well, at the very least no buildings have negative numbers Guy Chisholm provided this counterexample: Minusone Priory Road, Newbury, RG14 7QS (none of the databases I\u2019ve checked render this as -1)</li> <li>We can put those funny numbers into the building name field, as no buildings have both a name and a funny number Counterexample: Idas Court, 4-6 Princes Road, Hull, HU5 2RD</li> <li>When there\u2019s a building name, there won\u2019t be a building number (or vice-versa) Counterexample: Flat 1.4, Ziggurat Building, 60-66 Saffron Hill, London, EC1N 8QX, United Kingdom</li> <li>A building number will only be used once per street The difference between 50 Ammanford Road, Tycroes, Ammanford, SA18 3QJ and 50 Ammanford Road, Llandybie, Ammanford, SA18 3YF is about 4 miles (Google Maps).</li> <li>When there\u2019s line with a number in an address, it\u2019s the building number. Counterexample: Flat 18, Da Vinci House, 44 Saffron Hill, London, EC1N 8FH, United Kingdom You also get suite numbers, floor numbers, unit numbers, and organizations with numbers in their names. Adrien Pi\u00e9rard contributes an address from Japan with fifteen digits in five separate numbers. The format is: 980 0804 (zip code), Miyagi-ken (prefecture) Sendai-shi (city) Aoba-ku (district) Kokubuncho (Subdistrict) 4-10-20 (Sub-sub-district-number block-number building-number) Sendai (building name) 401 (flat number).</li> <li>OK, the first line starting with a number then Counterexample: 3 Store, 311-318 High Holborn, London, WC1V 7BN</li> <li>A building will only have one number Benton Lam offers this address from the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region - it has both a number on its road (14) and in its group of buildings (3): 15/F, Cityplaza 3, 14 TaiKoo Wan Road, Island East, HKSAR</li> <li>A building name won\u2019t also be a number Ben Tilly reports on Ten Post Office Sq, Boston MA 02109 USA - which is not, reportedly, the same as 10 Post Office Sq, Boston MA 02109 USA.</li> <li>A street with a building A will not also have a building Alpha Douglas Perreault reports he lived in a block within a condo association; it was a large association, with blocks A through Z then Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Theta. Mail and deliveries were often misrouted from block Alpha to block A and vice-versa. His address at the time was: 14100 N 46th St., Alpha 39, Tampa, FL 33613</li> <li>When there\u2019s a numbered street and a house number, there will be a separator between them Another from Jan Jongboom: Gondel 2695, Lelystad, means area Gondel, street 26, number 95</li> <li>Street names always end in descriptors like \u2018street\u2019, \u2018avenue\u2019, \u2018drive\u2019, \u2018square\u2019, \u2018hill\u2019 or \u2018view\u2019 They don\u2019t always - for example: Piccadilly, London, W1J 9PN</li> <li>OK, but when they do have a descriptor there will only be one A street name can be entirely descriptors: 17 Hill Street, London, W1J 5LJ</li> <li>OK, but when they do have a descriptor it will be at the end French addresses use prefix descriptors like \u2018rue\u2019, \u2018avenue\u2019, \u2018place\u2019 and \u2018allee\u2019.</li> <li>OK, but if there\u2019s a descriptor it\u2019ll be at the start or end of the street name. Or the middle, like 3 Bishops Square Business Park, Hatfield, AL10 9NA</li> <li>OK, but at the very least you wouldn\u2019t name a town Street Actually there\u2019s a town called Street in Somerset, UK.</li> <li>Street names don\u2019t end in numbers Jan Jongboom reports streets can be numbered in the Netherlands - for example, Plein 1944 in Nijmegen.</li> <li>Street numbers don\u2019t contain fractions Dan, Fred Kroon, David Underwood and Daniel Dickison submitted examples of fractional street numbers like 43rd \u00bd St, Pittsburgh, PA, and of fractional building numbers. These can be written in unicode (43rd \u00bd St), as a fraction with a slash (43 1/2) or as a decimal (43.5)</li> <li>Street names don\u2019t reoccur in the same city Here\u2019s a map of the following addresses:         \u25cb High Street, London, W3 6LJ         \u25cb High Street, London, W5 5DB         \u25cb High Street, London, N8 7PB         \u25cb High Street, London, SE25 6EP         \u25cb High Street, London, E13 0AJ         \u25cb High Street, London, E17 7LD         \u25cb High Street, London, NW10 4LX         \u25cb Islington High Street, London, N1 9TR         \u25cb Shoreditch High Street, London, E1 6PG         \u25cb Camden High Street, London, NW1 0JH         \u25cb Kensington High Street, London, W14 8NL         \u25cb Lewisham High Street, London, SE13 6AD         \u25cb High Street Wimbledon, London, SW19 5DX         \u25cb High Street Wanstead, London, E11 2AJ         \u25cb High Street Colliers Wood, London, SW19 2AE         \u25cb High Street North, London, E6 2HJ</li> <li>But street names don\u2019t recurr in close proximity Julian Fleischer provides an example from Bocholt in Germany showing several roads in close proximity all called Up de Welle.</li> <li>An address will be composed of road names Kirk Kerekes spent several years using an address of the form \"2 mi N then 3 mi W of Jennings, OK 74038\" which regularly got successful deliveries. Mike Riley used to mail the Very Large Array radio telescope at \"50 miles (80 km) West of Socorro, New Mexico, USA\" Sam pointed me to Menomonee Falls where houses are addressed using Milwaukee County\u2019s grid system instead of house numbers - giving addresses like N88 W16541 Foobar St. Andy Monat sent the following address example, from a semester abroad program at Tulane University: CIAPA, 50 meters north of the Hypermas/Walmart of Curridabat, San Jose, Costa Rica. Adrien Pi\u00e9rard and Luke Allardyce point out street names are seldom used in Japan - instead, districts and blocks numbers are used. A 2002 World Press Review report gave this sample address: From where the Chinese restaurant used to be, two blocks down, half a block toward the lake, next door to the house where the yellow car is parked, Managua, Nicaragua. Stig Brautaset pointed out a BBC article about post in Kabul gives this example: \"Hamid Jaan, behind Darul-Aman palace\". Nathan Fellman reports similar addressing is used in Nicaragua and Costa Rica. Paul Puschmann and Tibor Sch\u00fctz pointed out the city of Mannheim in Germany is sometimes called Quadratestadt (City of Squares) as the city centre is arranged in a grid, with blocks assigned a letter (along the north-south axis) and a number (along the east-west axis) then buildings numbered by block number. So an example address at numbers 6 to 13 on block R 5 would be: Institut f\u00fcr Deutsche Sprache, R 5, 6-13, D-68161 Mannheim Leoni Lubbinge gives an example of a South African address: Part 84, Strydfontein 306 JR, Pretoria which means the 84th plot of the farm Strydfontein 306 JR.</li> <li>A road will have a name Plenty of roads like driveways, onramps and the aisles of carparks don\u2019t have names.</li> <li>A road will only have one name Many different roads, from Goswell Road in London to Regent Road in Edinburgh, make up the 410 mile A1. And while there may only be one \"1 Goswell Road\" and only one \"1 Regent Road\" there are multiple buildings numbered 1 on the road designated A1. Roads may also be named in multiple languages. For example, in Ireland roads may be named in both English and Irish</li> <li>Addresses will only have one street The Royal Mail have what they call a \u2018dependent street\u2019 - for example: 6 Elm Avenue, Runcorn Road, Birmingham, B12 8QX, United Kingdom (Runcorn Road is the street, Elm Avenue is the stubby \u2018dependent street\u2019 and isn\u2019t unique within the city. Google Maps ) Another counterexample: Rogue Hair, 1 Hopton Parade, Streatham High Road, London, SW16 6EP (Streatham High Road is the street. Hopton Parade is a little row of shops on the road - Google Maps )</li> <li>Addresses will have a street The Royal Mail will deliver to certain premises by name, such as farms and cottages. Example: Oakland, Fairseat, Sevenoaks, TN15 7LT, United Kingdom (Fairseat is the town - this is actually on Vigo Road. Google Maps )</li> <li>An address will include a state in the US sense. Counterexample: Any address in the United Kingdom.</li> <li>Addresses will have something other than the organization and city name. Large recipients of mail are sometimes addressed by organization alone - for example: Electoral Reform Society Ltd, London, N1 1RS, United Kingdom</li> <li>An address will have a county Iain Parris and Naath both pointed out that, while many websites ask users for a county, not all countries use them in addressing. For example, the Royal Mail stopped using postal counties in 1996. Yves Daoust reports that in Belgium an address only requires a street, postcode and city; example: Boulevard Fr\u00e8re Orban, 27, 4000 Li\u00e8ge. Erik Engheim reports that in Norway Oslo is a By (city), Tettsted (urban area), Kommune (municipality) and Fylke (county) but it usually only appears once in a written address.</li> <li>An address require both a city and a country jzwinck points out Singapore is a city-state, leading to addresses like Singapore, Singapore - or even Singapore, Singapore, Singapore if you demand a city, county and country.</li> <li>You can\u2019t have two towns cities with the same name in the same country Sure you can - for example the UK has three towns called Newport. Jan Jongboom reports from the Netherlands, where there are two cities called Eursinge - in the same province!</li> <li>OK, but those cities won\u2019t have duplicate street names         \u25cb 10 High Street, Newport, PO30 1SS         \u25cb 10 High Street, Newport, NP20 1FQ         \u25cb 10 High Street, Newport, TF10 7AN</li> <li>An address will have a postcode Richard Fletcher, Lee Hosty, Paul O\u2019Nolan, Simon Diab, Tony Finn, Donal Maccarthy, mark lynch and Donovan all pointed out countries like the Republic of Ireland have addresses without postcodes, or only have postcodes in certain parts of the country. Danny Angus points out this is also the case in Hong Kong. Jessica Enders points out the post-paid address of the AEC: Australian Electoral Commission, Reply Paid 9867, your capital city</li> <li>The user will know their postal code/zip code. Most users will, of course, but I\u2019ve seen incorrect postcodes on corporate letterheads! Misreading handwritten postcodes seems like a common one.</li> <li>A single postcode will be larger than a single building Although zip codes in the US usually cover very large areas, Anthony Elizondo points out some buildings have their own zip codes - like the Empire State Building (10118) In the UK, alphanumeric postcodes are typically much more precise than US zip codes.</li> <li>OK, but you don\u2019t get multiple postcodes per building Graham Lee points out DVLA Swansea (that\u2019s the whole address), where different departments are identified by postcode: V5Cs are processed at SA99 1BA, driving licences at SA99 1AB and so on. Malcolm Gilbert points out this example, with five postcodes for five departments:         \u25cb London Borough of Enfield, Civic Centre, Silver Street, ENFIELD, EN1 3ES         \u25cb Returning Officer, London Borough of Enfield, Civic Centre, Silver Street, ENFIELD, EN1 9SA         \u25cb Edmonton, London Borough of Enfield, Civic Centre, Silver Street, ENFIELD, EN1 9SB         \u25cb Enfield North, London Borough of Enfield, Civic Centre, Silver Street, ENFIELD, EN1 9SD         \u25cb Enfield Southgate, London Borough of Enfield, Civic Centre, Silver Street, ENFIELD, EN1 3ZW         \u25cb But the Enfield council website contact page lists their postcode as EN1 3XY - which the Royal Mail think is a PO Box at the sorting office.</li> <li>A single postcode will only cover a few tens of addresses / customers Mostly this is reasonable in the UK, but there are certain exceptions. For example CV4 7AL is the postcode of the University of Warwick - one postcode for 6,000 students living on campus, and academics/administrators working on campus. Also, if your customers get things delivered to them when they\u2019re on holiday, lots of customers may have the same holiday parks on their accounts. Some addresses correspond to \u2018flexible office spaces\u2019 and organizations that offer PO Boxes that sound like fancy offices. The Royal Mail lists more than 90 organizations operating out of Tower 42, 25 Old Broad Street, London, EC2N 1HQ. Holiday parks and cottages may also appear on many customers\u2019 accounts. Victor Nicollet contributes the example of French postcode 75015, representing the XVth arrondissement of Paris, which covers over 230,000 people.</li> <li>A zip code corresponds to a single city Mike Cohen reports zip code 33334 covers 3 cities: Oakland Park, Wilton Manors, and Fort Lauderdale, all in Florida.</li> <li>Zip codes don\u2019t start with a zero Some Brazilian zip codes do according to speeder, as do Israeli postcodes for army units. Jessica Enders and Frank Malcolm pointed out postcodes in the Northern Territory of Australia start with 08; for example the postcode for the city Darwin is 0800. Morsillo Lindsay, Thomas Norris and Jerry B. Altzman point out American addresses in the north east have zip codes starting with zero, for example Ten Post Office Sq, Boston MA 02109, USA; and some zip codes start with two zeros. Mikael Vejdemo-Johansson reports the zip code of Jena in Germany is 07737. Antti Vikman and Johan Myr\u00e9en tell me all postcodes in Helsinki, the capital of Finland, all start with two zeroes. Some special codes even start with four zeroes (00002 HELSINKI). Andrew Jones reports the initial digits of French postcodes are the department, and may use a leading zero. Post addressed to 06130 Grasse is correctly delivered to the town in district 06, Alpes Maritimes - but post addressed to 6130 Grasse is first routed to department 61, Orne. klez reports Italian Codice di Avviamento Postale (CAP) numbers can have a leading zero.</li> <li>Addresses will have a reasonable number of characters - less than 100, say. Not when organization and department names can be included in addresses! For example: Department For Environment Food &amp; Rural Affairs (D E F R A), State Veterinary Service, Animal Health Office, Hadrian House, Wavell Drive, Rosehill Industrial Estate, Carlisle, CA1 2TB, United Kingdom Another example: The Gynaecology Cancer Research Unit, Department of Obstetrics &amp; Gynaecology, St. Bartholomews &amp; The Royal School of Medicine &amp; Dentistry, Charterhouse Square, London, EC1M 6GR, United Kingdom</li> <li>But street names will be reasonably short - certainly less than 50 characters Susanne Schmidt provides the longest street name in Germany: Bisch\u00f6flich-Geistlicher-Rat-Josef-Zinnbauer-Stra\u00dfe in 84130 Dingolfing, Bavaria Graham Rhind suggests this 89-character street name in Bihac, Bosnia: Aleja Alije Izetbegovi\u0107a Prvig Predsjednika Predsjedni\u0161tva Republika Bosna i Hercegovina</li> <li>Five lines and country will cover all cases. You\u2019ll need 8 lines and country to deliver to: GB Technical Services, Unit W7a, Warwick House, 18 Forge Lane, Minworth Industrial Park, Minworth, Sutton Coldfield, B76 1AH, United Kingdom</li> <li>Addresses don\u2019t contain commas (so I can replace newlines with commas then commas with newlines and get back to where I was) Addresses can contain organization names, and organization names can contain commas. For example: Society of College, National &amp; University Libraries, 102 Euston Street, London, NW1 2HA</li> <li>But they don\u2019t contain commas, brackets, apostrophes, hyphens, ampersands, dots or exclamation marks St. Judes &amp; St. Pauls C of E (Va) Primary School, 10 Kingsbury Road, London, N1 4AZ 1 Acre View, Bo\u2019ness, EH51 9RQ 1 Highview Terrace, Westward Ho!, Bideford, EX39 1AQ (exclamation mark is omitted in some databases) Flat 1.4, Ziggurat Building, 60-66 Saffron Hill, London, EC1N 8QX, United Kingdom Kirkland, Lane, Mathias &amp; Perry, North Muskham Prebend Church Street, Southwell, NG25 0HQ Mark Wallace tells us The Hague in the Netherlands is has multiple official names, one of which is \u2019s-Gravenhage (not a plural, literally a city name starting apostrophe s and with a hyphen) Signposts for Station Road East, Grantham, NG31 6HX render it as STATION ROAD (EAST). More generally, addresses can contain organization names, and organizations can have names like Yahoo! with an exclamation mark. Legislation on company sets out the allowable characters for the UK and it permits company names including ! LTD (company 08209948); @ LTD (company 08209882); $ LTD (company 08209885) and % LTD (company 04487680) as well as a variety of other names I don\u2019t have examples for as the companies house website won\u2019t let me search for them.</li> <li>An address will exist in the country\u2019s postal service\u2019s database Simon Westcott points out databases are only released periodically, so it\u2019s not unusual for new buildings to be omitted.</li> <li>An address in the country\u2019s postal service\u2019s database will exist Royal Mail and Ordnance Survey data can contain demolished buildings, and buildings currently under construction. The Royal Mail even have a database product called Not Yet Built. Temporary postcodes can even be assigned to building sites!</li> <li>The address from the postal service database is sufficient to deliver Christopher Allen points out that people in new blocks of flats and houseboats in boatyards sometimes need to prefix their official address with a boat name or flat number.</li> <li>Every address can be expressed in a way that will pass all validators XaspR8d must have been exasperated by the fact his road is variously known as \"S Hwy X\", \"Highway X\" and \"South County Rd X\" - and related a story of being unable to buy a product as the only addresses that passed a vendor\u2019s address validation wouldn\u2019t pass his bank\u2019s address validation and vice-versa. Jon Peterson lives in an apartment community that is divided into Quail Ridge Cir, Quail Ridge East Lane and Quail Ridge West Lane. Only the USPS and the city electric utility seem to recognize the \"Lane\". Everyone else requires it be shortened to \"Quail Rdg E\" (or W) and reportedly when UPS turns a package over to the USPS it gets returned as undeliverable-no such address. Susannah Fleming lived on the road the Royal Mail call Top O\u2019The Lane, Brindle, Chorley, PR6 8PA. She reports representations in different databases include:         \u25cb Top o\u2019 th\u2019 Lane         \u25cb Top o\u2019th\u2019 Lane         \u25cb Top oth Lane         \u25cb Top o\u2019 the Lane         \u25cb Top of the Lane         \u25cb Workhouse Lane (a historical name of the road)         \u25cb Denham Lane (name of the road continuation)</li> <li>Customers will have a fixed address with a fixed location A developer just a few seats from me recently brought a house boat with the intention of using it as her primary residence. Needless to say, boats can move - including between towns and even countries! fr0sty points out the State of Illinois catch-all approach to addresses: \"IF YOU HAVE NO STREET ADDRESS, below describe your home: list the name of subdivision; cross streets; roads; landmarks; mileage and/or neighbors\u2019 names.\" Sharon Freas has dealt with systems supporting \"Snowbird\" clients, who alternate between addresses with the changing seasons.</li> <li>But written addresses don\u2019t change Addresses can move between counties and administrative districts. For example, I used to live in the county Gwent, but that no longer exists. Addresses may also be assigned new postcodes. Susanne Schmidt points out cities, streets and entire countries were renamed in eastern europe - for example, when Lenin fell out of favour as a street name. Addresses can be in disputed territories, or even war zones. Douglas Perreault reports owning a condo that changed address three times; first it was 14100 N 46th St., Alpha 39, Lutz, FL 33549; then a new post office was built and it became 14100 N 46th St., Alpha 39, Tampa, FL 33612; then the ZIP Code changed giving 14100 N 46th St., Alpha 39, Tampa, FL 33613; then the condo association changed to a less error-prone block naming scheme, giving 14410 Hanging Moss Circle, #101, Tampa, FL 33613.</li> <li>Postal, traditional and administrative counties all line up, right? As you can learn from wikipedia\u2019s page on postal counties, even when the Royal Mail used postal counties, they didn\u2019t always line up with administrative counties. And of course administrative regions come and go with changes to local government structures - for example, the county I was born in in no longer exists.</li> <li>Military addresses are just like regular addresses Peter Bailey points out several countries have special military mail to deal with the complexities of delivering to soldiers deployed to other countries, ships at sea and similar; and their addresses don\u2019t always follow conventional address formats. For example, the address BFPO, BF1 4FB is the address of the navy vessel HMS Example. Ed Schiebel reports the postcodes allocated to Israeli army units roam around with the units.</li> <li>An address corresponds to the recipient\u2019s location. Addresses such as PO boxes are often only as precise as the recipient\u2019s city or sorting office. Jessica Enders tells me the Australian post service Reply Paid addresses (no stamp needed); PO Boxes (Post Office Boxes); GPO Boxes (General Post Office Boxes, in the middle of capital cities only); locked bags; private bags; parcel lockers; parcel collect; \"Care of Post Office\"; CMA (Community Mail Agent); CPA (Community Postal Agent); CMB (Community Mail Bag) and Mail Service (MS)! Tibor Sch\u00fctz points out many post offices have novelty handling of mail to Santa Claus, even going as far as to allocate special postcodes. For example: Santa Claus Nordpolen, Julemandes Postkontor, DK-3900 Nuuk</li> <li>An address can be expressed with a single country Matthieu Valleton got in touch to point out his address on Kerguelen Island (Google Map), a French territory in the Indian Ocean, his address was District de Kerguelen (island), Terres Australes et Antarctiques Fran\u00e7aises (territory), via la R\u00e9union (indicates where the mail should be routed through), France (country)</li> <li>Overseas territories aren\u2019t (or are) always included in the postal code system Monty points out that uncommon political hierarchies can lead to uncommon postal addresses. For example, the entire of the Falkland Islands shares postal code FIQQ 1ZZ. On the other hand, the British Virgin Islands have their own postal code system.</li> <li>All addresses with a box number are PO Boxes David Kuder pointed me to a 1990 article: Risks Digest correspondent Tim Kay had problems getting mail sent to his university campus pigeon hole: Timothy L.

Douglas Perreault reports units within American condo associations may be written below the street name. For example: 14100 (position of condo association on street) N 46th St. (street name), Alpha (block within condo association) 39 (unit within block), Lutz (city), FL (state) 33549 (zip). Likewise, when mailing an individual at a company some people put the person\u2019s name after the company name, but before the street name.</li> <li>OK, but at least the same address will always be written in the same order Gy\u00f6rgy Farkas tells me Hungarian addresses can be written in different orders depending on how many lines are available. If you write the address on one line, it\u2019s expressed from less specific to more specific: {zip} {town}, {street} {buildingNr}. If there are more lines available, the address starts with the street, and if the country is specified, it comes after the town name: {street} {buildingNr}. {zip} {town}, {country} And if there are no set number of lines, like on an envelope, it\u2019s a bit different again: {street} {buildingNr}. {town} {zip}</li> <li>Building numbers appear before street names In some countries this is reversed - such as in the Netherlands. For example, Plein 1944 85 D (where Plein 1944 identifies the street, 85 the building and D the flat/apartment).</li> <li>Flat names/numbers names appear before building numbers Toni Cornelissen points out addresses in the Netherlands, such as: Vroomstraat 1a Rood, 2021HL Haarlem where Vroomstaat is the street, 1a is the building number, and Rood (literally translated as Red) indicates the upper part of the building.</li> <li>A building will be within a few hundred meters of a public road Buildings like farms and country houses can be at the end of a private road or driveway several hundred meters long.</li> <li>An address with a street name is always closer to that street than any other Lots of examples of this. For example: The National Museum of Computing, Bletchley Park, Sherwood Drive, Bletchley, Milton Keynes, MK3 6EB. 70m from Roche Gardens, 346m from Sherwood Drive, but only accessible by entering Bletchley Park from Sherwood Drive.</li> <li>The number of buildings is the difference between the highest and lowest building numbers Tibor Sch\u00fctz points out building numbers may be skipped - for example, on a street where even-numbered buildings are on one side, odd numbers on the other; multiple buildings sharing the same number (such as where a new house has been built) and buildings with more than one number.</li> <li>Real place names won\u2019t contain rude words It\u2019s not just Middlesex and Scunthorpe you have to check for; Gary Gale has compiled a map of rude-sounding place names.</li> <li>A customer will only want reminders mailed to single address John Dye reports that many doctors\u2019 offices, dentists and so on are unable to mail both of a child\u2019s divorced parents.</li> <li>Each person has exactly one address Tibor Sch\u00fctz points out people often have a different home and work address.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"tech/standards/names.html#places-have-only-one-official-name","title":"Places have only one official name","text":"<ul> <li>Buildings do not move.

Some people do not own phones, or do not wish to provide you with their telephone number when asked. Do not require a user to provide a phone number unless it is essential, and whenever possible try to provide a fallback to accommodate these users.</li> <li>You can make a call to any phone number. Some devices such as EFTPOS terminals, fax machines and mobile internet dongles may not support receiving calls. In addition, some people can not use their phones for phone calls. This may be permanent (such as a hearing disability), temporary (temporary hearing loss) or situational (when the user is in a noisy environment).</li> <li>An individual has only one phone number.</li> <li>A phone number uniquely identifies an individual. It wasn't even that long ago that mobile phones didn't exist, and it was common for an entire household to share one fixed-line telephone number. In some parts of the world, this is still true, and relatives (or even friends) share a single phone number. Many phone services (especially for businesses) allow multiple inbound calls to or outbound calls from the same phone number.</li> <li>Phone numbers cannot be re-used. Old phone numbers are recycled and get reassigned to other people.</li> <li>Phone numbers that are valid today will always be valid. Phone numbers of a certain type today (e.g., mobile) will never be reassigned to another type. A phone number which connects today may be disconnected tomorrow. A number which is free to call today may cost money to call tomorrow. The phone company may decide to expand the range of available phone numbers by inserting a digit into an existing number.</li> <li>Each country calling code corresponds to exactly one country Example: The USA, Canada, and several Caribbean islands share the country calling code +1. Russia and Kazakhstan share +7.</li> <li>Each country has only one country calling code. As of this present moment (in Mar. 2016), phones in the disputed territory and partially recognised state of Kosovo may be reached by dialing the country calling code for Serbia (+381), Slovenia (+386), or Monaco (+377), depending on where and when one obtained the number.</li> <li>A phone number is dialable from anywhere Some numbers can only be dialed within the country. Some can only be dialled from within a subset of countries, such as the +800 Universal International Freephone Numbers. Some may be dialable only if the caller is a subscriber to a particular telecom company.</li> <li>You can send a text message to any phone number. A lot of people still only have a fixed-line telephone, which typically cannot send or receive text messages.</li> <li>Only mobile phones can receive text messages. Some service providers support sending and receiving text messages to fixed-line numbers. There are also online services like Skype that can send and receive text messages.</li> <li>There are only two ways to dial a phone number: domestically and from overseas. Some numbers may need different prefixes depending on: the carrier you are using; what device you are dialling from/to; whether you are inside or outside a particular geographical region.Examples: In Brazil, to dial numbers internally but across a certain geographical boundary, a carrier code must be explicitly dialed to say which carrier you will use to pay for the call. In Nepal, the leading zero in national format is omitted depending on whether the originating phone is mobile or fixed-line. In New Zealand, you need to dial the area-code (e.g. 03) even if the number is within the same area-code region as you are, unless it is \"close\" (something approximating city/district boundaries), in which case it shouldn\u2019t be dialled.</li> <li>To make a number dialable, you only need to change the prefix In Argentina, to dial a mobile number domestically, the digits \"15\" need to be inserted after the area code but before the local number, and the \"9\" after the country code (54) needs to be removed. This transforms +54 9 2982 123456 into 02982 15 123456.</li> <li>No prefix of a valid phone number can be a valid phone number In some countries, it's possible to connect to a different endpoint by dialing more digits after a number. So \"12345678\" may not reach the same person as dialing \"123456\".</li> <li>An invalid number will not reach an endpoint In some countries, or on some phones, extra digits are thrown away. Hence,    1-800-MICROSOFT is an invalid number - but it still connects to Microsoft, since any later digits are ignored. Numbers such as \"911\" can be reached by dialling \"911 123\" in some countries: but not in others. In other countries, invalid numbers may be \"fixed\" by a carrier, e.g., adding a mobile token if they know it is a mobile number, such that it connects.</li> <li>All valid phone numbers follow the ITU specifications ITU-T specifies that a phone number cannot be longer than fifteen digits,   with one to three digits reserved for the country calling code, but valid numbers in Germany have been assigned that are longer than this.</li> <li>All valid phone numbers belong to a country There are many \"country calling codes\" issued to non-geographical entities, such as satellite services, and the \"800\" code for Universal International Freephone Numbers.</li> <li>Phone numbers contain only digits In Israel, certain advertising numbers start with a <code>*</code>. In New Zealand, non-urgent traffic incidents can be reported by calling <code>*555</code> from a mobile phone. Alpha characters may also be used in phone numbers, such as in <code>1-800-Flowers</code>.</li> <li>Phone numbers are always written in ASCII In Egypt, it is common for phone numbers to be written in native digits.</li> <li>Phone numbers have only one prefix (area code or national destination code) at a given time In the mid-90s in Iceland, phone numbers changed from 5 and 6 digits to 7 digits. The old system had regional prefixes, but the new one doesn't. During the transition period, phone numbers could be reached by the old area code or the new 7 digit number (a different prefix). For example, a Reykjavik phone number could be dialed with <code>nnnnn</code> and <code>55nnnnn</code> inside the region, and <code>91-nnnnn</code> and <code>55nnnnn</code> from outside.</li> <li>A leading zero in numbers formatted for domestic usage can always be discarded when dialing from abroad In some countries, people write the national prefix in brackets (typically <code>(0)</code>) after the country calling code to indicate that it should be discarded when dialing internationally. In Italy, since 1998, the prefix was \"fixed\" to the phone numbers, so that <code>(01) 2345</code> became <code>012345</code> and should be dialed (internationally) as <code>+39012345</code> (including the leading zero).</li> <li>The country or area code of a phone number indicates the user's location, place of residence, time-zone, or preferred language There are many reasons for someone to have a phone number issued in a state or region other than where they reside or hold citizenship. These include, but are not limited to:Moving within a country: In countries with phone number portability, you may retain your number when moving, even in some cases if it is a fixed-line number and even if it has an area code (see xkcd for a US example.) Moving to another country: Some people keep their mobile phones when they move to another country.Geopolitical turmoil: Sometimes countries change their borders, cease to exist, or come into existence.Business, family, and friends: A business may have many customers in a neighbouring country, or a person may have many family and friends there.Wanting cheaper rates: VoIP is often cheaper than regular calls. People traveling around Europe may get a SIM card from one country and have a roaming plan. Note that geographical area codes are assigned in some countries to mobile phones.</li> <li>The plus sign in front of phone numbers in international format is optional, or can always be replaced by <code>00</code> The plus sign is part of the E.164 format for international telephone numbers. It can be replaced with the international call prefix when dialing internationally. Note that while <code>00</code> is a common international call prefix, this actually varies by country. In North America, which has a country calling code of <code>+1</code>, it is a common error to drop the <code>+</code> in front of the number and write it like <code>1-555-123-4567</code>. This is technically incorrect. To call this number from Japan, where the international call prefix is <code>010</code>, one may dial either <code>+1 555 123 4567</code> or <code>010 1 555 123 4567</code>.</li> <li>Users will only store phone numbers in your product's phone number fields Some users use their contact lists to store things like birthdays or other information. Unless a piece of user-supplied data has actually been verified to be a phone number, it should be stored as-is as entered by the user.</li> <li>Phone numbers are numbers Never try to store phone numbers as an int or any other kind of numeric data type. You can't do arithmetic on them, and while 007, 07 and 7 are the same number they are not necessarily the same phone number - in some countries a leading 0 is significant and forms part of the number itself (see A leading zero in numbers formatted for domestic usage can always be discarded when dialing from abroad).

Australian Eastern Standard Time is UTC+1000. e.g. 10:00 UTC is 20:00 EST on the same day.</li> <li>Daylight saving does not affect UTC. It's just a polity deciding to change its timezone (offset from UTC). For example, GMT is still used: it's the British national timezone in winter. In summer it becomes BST.</li> <li>Leap seconds: By international convention, UTC (which is an arbitrary human invention) is kept within 0.9 seconds of physical reality (UT1, which is a measure of solar time) by introducing a \"leap second\" in the last minute of the UTC year, or in the last minute of June.</li> <li>Leap seconds don't have to be announced much more than six months before they happen. This is a problem if you need second-accurate planning beyond six months.</li> <li>Unix time: Measured as the number of seconds since epoch (the beginning of 1970 in UTC). Unix time is not affected by time zones or daylight saving.</li> <li>According to POSIX.1, Unix time is supposed to handle a leap second by replaying the previous second. e.g.:</li> </ul> <pre><code>59.00\n59.25\n59.50\n59.75\n59.00 \u2190 replay\n59.25\n59.50\n59.75\n00.00 \u2190 increment\n00.25\n</code></pre> <p>This is a trade-off: you can't represent a leap second, and your time is guaranteed to go backwards. On the other hand, every day is exactly 86,400 seconds long, and you don't need a table of all previous and future leap seconds in order to format Unix time as human-preferred hours-minutes-seconds. ntpd is supposed to make the replay happen after it sees the \"leap bits\" from upstream timeservers, but I've also seen it do nothing: the system goes one second into the future, then slowly slews back to the correct time.</p> <ul> <li>Don't blindly use gettimeofday(). If you need a monotonic (always increasing) clock, have a look at clock_gettime().</li> <li>If you want to store a humanly-readable time (e.g. logs), consider storing it along with Unix time, not instead of Unix time.</li> <li>Most of your code shouldn't be dealing with timezones or local time, it should be passing Unix time around.</li> <li>MySQL (at least 4.x and 5.x) stores DATETIME columns as a \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\" string. I'm not even kidding. If you care at all about storing timestamps, store them as integers and use the UNIX_TIMESTAMP() and FROM_UNIXTIME() functions.</li> <li>The number of \"clock\" seconds per \"real\" second is both inaccurate and variable. It mostly varies with temperature.</li> <li>The system clock can, and will, jump backwards and forwards in time due to things outside of your control. Your program should be designed to survive this.</li> <li>The system clock is inaccurate.</li> <li>Time passes at a rate of one second per second for every observer. The frequency of a remote clock relative to an observer is affected by velocity and gravity. The clocks inside GPS satellites are adjusted for relativistic effects.</li> <li>Timezones are a presentation-layer problem!</li> <li>When displaying time, always include the timezone offset. A time format without an offset is useless.</li> <li>When measuring time, measure Unix time. It's UTC. It's easy to obtain. It doesn't have timezone offsets or daylight saving (or leap seconds).</li> <li>When storing time, store Unix time. It's a single number.</li> <li>You're on a network? Every other system's clock is differently inaccurate. ntpd can change the system time in two ways: 1) Step: making the clock jump backwards or forwards to the correct time instantaneously. 2) Slew: changing the frequency of the clock so that it slowly drifts toward the correct time. \u2192 Slew is preferred because it's less disruptive, but it's only useful for correcting small offsets.</li> </ul> <p>Sources:</p> <ul> <li>https://blog.wesleyac.com/posts/timezone-bullshit</li> </ul>"},{"location":"tech/standards/time.html#falsehoods-about-dates","title":"Falsehoods about Dates","text":"<p>All of these assumptions are wrong:</p> <ul> <li>24:12:34 is an invalid time</li> <li>A given date and/or time unambiguously identifies a unique moment.</li> <li>A time stamp of sufficient precision can safely be considered unique.</li> <li>A timestamp represents the time that an event actually occurred.</li> <li>A week (or a month) always begins and ends in the same year.</li> <li>A week always begins and ends in the same month.</li> <li>All measurements of time on a given clock will occur within the same frame of reference.</li> <li>Any 24-hour period will always begin and end in the same day (or week, or month).</li> <li>Britain uses GMT.</li> <li>But at least the numerical difference between the displayed and stored year will be less than 2</li> <li>But if you print a date time, you can write the numbers character for character, without needing to backtrack</li> <li>But it will work, if both years are leap years</li> <li>But you can ignore the millisecond fraction, if it is less than 0.5</li> <li>Changes in the offsets between time zones will occur with plenty of advance notice.</li> <li>Contiguous timezones are no more than an hour apart.

Grasping the distinction between Korean and international age is vital for those engaging with Korean culture. Upon birth, Koreans are already considered a year old, reflecting the time in the womb. Furthermore, every individual's age advances by a year on New Year's Day, irrespective of their actual birth date. Consequently, a Korean's age is consistently one to two years greater than their international counterpart.</p> <p>The international age system, adopted by the majority of countries, increments a person's age annually on their birthday. By June 2023, to mitigate confusion, the Korean government resolved to exclusively use the international age system for official and legal documentation. This shift means Koreans' official age will now be one to two years less than what's calculated using the traditional Korean method.</p> <p>In Korean culture, age profoundly influences social dynamics, language nuances, and societal expectations. For example, it's customary for younger individuals to pour drinks, while their elders often cover meal expenses. Inquiring about age in Korea varies based on the individual's age and one's relationship with them, with distinct formal, standard, and informal phrasings. Legal age thresholds, such as for alcohol consumption, align with the international age system. To illustrate, while the Korean age for legal drinking is 20, it translates to 19 in international terms. Though Koreans universally age up on January 1st, personal birthday celebrations occur on the actual date of birth. When two Koreans are of the same age, they refer to their peer relationship as \"\ub3d9\uac11 (donggap).\" This age parity often eases interactions, eliminating the usual age-related social protocols.</p> <p>Calculating Korean Age:</p> <p>Calculating Korean age is relatively straightforward. Here's how you can determine someone's Korean age:</p> <ul> <li>Start with the Current Year: Begin by taking the current year. For example, if it's 2023, start with that number.</li> <li>Subtract the Birth Year: Deduct the person's birth year from the current year.</li> <li>Add One Year: Since in Korea, a baby is considered one year old at birth (accounting for the time spent in the womb), you add one year to the result from step 2.</li> </ul> <p>For example, if someone was born in 2000 and the current year is 2023:</p> <p>2023 (current year) - 2000 (birth year) = 23 23 + 1 = 24</p> <p>So, the person's Korean age in 2023 would be 24.</p> <p>However, there's one more thing to consider: New Year's Adjustment: Everyone's age in Korea increases by one year on New Year's Day, regardless of their actual birth date. This means if someone's birthday hasn't occurred yet in the current year, their Korean age will be two years more than their international age. Using the example above, if the person's birthday is in July and it's currently February 2023, they would still be 23 in international age but 24 in Korean age.</p> <p>In summary, the formula is:</p> <p>Korean Age = (Current Year - Birth Year) + 1</p> <p>Remember the New Year's adjustment when considering birthdays later in the year.</p>"},{"location":"tech/standards/time.html#fun-facts","title":"Fun facts","text":"<p>A moment was a medieval unit of time.

Dissectors are used to analyze and decode the data packets and put the raw data into a human-readable format. Each dissector is designed for a specific protocol (such as TCP, HTTP, FTP, etc.). It understands the structure of the protocol, e.g. header, payload and footer. The dissector takes the bytes of a packet belonging to its protocol and breaks them down into the various fields and elements defined in the protocol's specification. This process allows users to view, analyze and understand the details of network traffic in a structured and meaningful way.</p> <p>Source:

While the JRE is solely intended for end-users running Java applications and omits developer tools, the JDK enables both compilation and execution, making it essential for development workflows. Since Java 9, the standalone JRE is no longer offered separately, and modularization via JPMS allows developers to create custom, minimized runtimes using tools like jlink. In practice, the JDK now serves as the default distribution for both development and production, while the historical distinction between JDK and JRE is largely obsolete except in legacy contexts.</p>"},{"location":"tech/tools/cli/jdk.html#tool-overview","title":"Tool overview","text":"<p>Some tools in the JDK with a simple example:</p> Tool Purpose Example Command javac Compile Java source code <code>javac HelloWorld.java</code> java Run Java programs <code>java HelloWorld</code> jar Package/distribute Java applications <code>jar cf app.jar *.class</code> javadoc Generate API documentation <code>javadoc -d doc HelloWorld.java</code> jdb Debug Java applications <code>jdb HelloWorld</code> jconsole Monitor/manage Java apps (GUI) <code>jconsole</code> jvisualvm Visual profiling/monitoring (GUI) <code>jvisualvm</code> jstack View thread stack traces <code>jstack &lt;pid&gt;</code> jmap Memory stats/heap dumps <code>jmap -heap &lt;pid&gt;</code> jstat JVM stats (GC, class loading, etc.) <code>jstat -gc &lt;pid&gt;</code> jps List Java processes <code>jps</code> jinfo JVM configuration info <code>jinfo &lt;pid&gt;</code> jshell Interactive Java shell (REPL) <code>jshell</code> javap Disassemble class files <code>javap HelloWorld</code> keytool Manage keys/certificates/keystores <code>keytool -genkeypair -alias mykey -keystore mykeystore.jks</code> serialver Show serialVersionUID for classes <code>serialver HelloWorld</code> jlink Custom runtime image creation (Java 9+) <code>jlink --module-path mods --add-modules com.example.helloworld --output helloworld-runtime</code>"},{"location":"tech/tools/cli/jdk.html#comparing-builds","title":"Comparing builds","text":"Name License Supported By Open Source Free LTS Target Audience/Notes Oracle JDK NFTC (Java 17+), earlier BCL Oracle No Yes Yes Official JDK, enterprise support OpenJDK GPLv2 + Classpath Community Yes Yes Yes Upstream, most other JDKs are based on this Amazon Corretto GPLv2 + Classpath Amazon Yes Yes Yes Free, supported by AWS, LTS Microsoft OpenJDK MIT (binaries), GPLv2 (src) Microsoft Yes Yes Yes For Azure, free, open source Eclipse Temurin GPLv2 + Classpath Eclipse Foundation Yes Yes Yes Broad adoption, successor to AdoptOpenJDK Red Hat OpenJDK GPLv2 + Classpath Red Hat Yes Yes Yes Default for RHEL, commercial support Azul Zulu OpenJDK GPLv2 + Classpath Azul Systems Yes Yes Yes Commercial/enterprise options SAP SapMachine GPLv2 + Classpath SAP Yes Yes Yes For SAP users"},{"location":"tech/tools/cli/jdk.html#keytool","title":"keytool","text":"<p>Keytool is a command-line utility that comes with the Java Development Kit (JDK).

This DMARC policy influences the way email is handled, however failing emails will still arrive.</li> <li>Reject (p=reject): With the DMARC reject policy, Internet Service Providers who've DMARC will reject all emails that fail the DMARC check. All these email will bounce and will not end up in any folder of the receiver. This DMARC policy makes sure emails failing the DMARC check will not arrive. Be aware that everything should be in place otherwise legitimate email might be blocked.</li> <li>Policy percentage (pct=90 for 90%): The percentage tag instructs ISPs to only apply the DMARC policy to a percentage of failing emails. 'pct=50' will instruct receivers to only apply the policy for 50% of the emails that fail the DMARC check. NOTE: this will not work for the 'none' policy, but only for the 'quarantine' or 'reject' policies. E.g. for \"100%\" -&gt; 100% of the messages will be filtered. The policy percentage can be a number form 1 to 100. Default is 100 which is all messages.</li> </ul> <p>Alignment mode (adkim/aspf tag):</p> <p>Since alignment is a key part of the DMARC implementation (without alignment you can't enforce your policy), it is possible to choose how alignment should be handled for DKIM signatures and your SPF setup. The chosen alignment mode influences when alignment is achieved. You can choose to set the alignment mode to 'r' (Relaxed) or 's' (Strict).</p> <ul> <li>DKIM alignment mode (adkim=s): For DKIM this means that the domain used to create the signature (and provided through the d= parameter), should match the \u2018From' header. In Relaxed mode authenticated DKIM signing domains (d=) that share an organizational domain with an emails \u2018From' domain will pass the DMARC check. In strict mode an exact match is required in order to achieve alignment.</li> <li>SPF alignment mode (aspf=s): For SPF this means that the \u2018Return-Path' header should match the \u2018From' header. In Relaxed mode authenticated SPF domains that share an organizational domain with an emails \u2018From' domain will pass the DMARC check. In strict mode an exact match is required in order to achieve alignment.</li> </ul> <p>Forensic options (fo tag)</p> <p>Determines in which case you want to receive forensic reports:</p> <ul> <li>Report failures if all alignment and authentication fails</li> <li>Report failures if DKIM or SPF does not align and authentication fails (fo=1)</li> <li>Report failures if DKIM fails (fo=d)</li> <li>Report failures if SPF fails (fo=s)</li> </ul>"},{"location":"tech/tools/office/email.html#mta-sts-mitigates-mitm-attacks","title":"MTA-STS (mitigates MitM Attacks)","text":"<p>Mail Transfer Agent Strict Transport Security is an email security standard which lets senders know that your email server accepts secure email delivery using SMTP over TLS (STARTTLS), and that email should not be delivered over an insecure SMTP connection.
