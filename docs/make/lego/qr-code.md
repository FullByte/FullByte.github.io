# QR-Code

I created a Lego QR Code linking to [this page](https://0xfab1.net/make/lego/qr-code/ "https://0xfab1.net/make/lego/qr-code/") with [Bricklink Studio](https://www.bricklink.com/v3/studio/download.page "https://www.bricklink.com/v3/studio/download.page").

To create the QR-Code I used [qrious](https://github.com/neocotic/qrious "https://github.com/neocotic/qrious") by [neocotic](https://neocotic.dev/ "https://neocotic.dev/").
To match the size of available lego base plates I chose Level "M" with 15% damage and zero padding.
Classic QR-Codes have black and white pixels so i went with that look by Qrious as well as in Bricklink.

The value "https://0xfab1.net/make/lego/qr-code/" results in this QR-Code
