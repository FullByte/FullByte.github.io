# Boxes.py

"Boxes.py" is an [online](https://www.festi.info/boxes.py/index.html) and [Inkscape plug-in](https://github.com/florianfesti/boxes) with ready-to-use, fully parametrized generators for various boxes.

Boxes is great for laser cutters that are powerful enough to cut through wood:

Sofar I tested cuts with these fiberboard types:

- 2,5 mm MDF
- 3,0 mm MDF (best)
- 3,0 mm HDF

With these laser cutters (both work well):

- [Epilog Zing 6040](https://www.epiloglaser.de/)
- [Trotec Speedy 360](https://www.troteclaser.com)

This is a script I wrote to install and run boxes locally on Windows 10:
