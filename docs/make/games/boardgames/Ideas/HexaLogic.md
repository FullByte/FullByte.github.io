# HexaLogic

Number of players: 2 Age range: 10 and up

Objective: The objective of the game is to use logic gates to direct the flow of signals to the correct output.

Equipment:

- A set of hexagonal tiles, each representing a different type of logic gate (such as AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, and XNOR)
- A set of input tiles, numbered 1 to 4, representing the input signals
- An output tile, representing the final output signal
- A deck of cards with different signal combinations

Gameplay:

1.  Set up the board by placing the input tiles at the top and the output tile at the bottom.
2.  Each player selects a set of logic gate tiles.
3.  Shuffle the deck of cards and draw a card to determine the desired output signal combination.
4.  Players take turns placing a logic gate tile on the board, connecting it to the input tiles and other logic gate tiles to build a logic circuit.
5.  The first player to create a circuit that outputs the required signal combination wins the game.
6.  Players must follow the rules of Boolean algebra when placing their tiles, ensuring that the circuit they build is a valid logic circuit.
7.  The game ends after all the cards have been used, and the player with the most wins is the winner.

This game combines the challenge of building a functioning logic circuit with the added element of the cards, providing a different output signal combination for each game. It's easy to understand but difficult to master, making it a fun and engaging game for players who enjoy puzzles and logic problems.
