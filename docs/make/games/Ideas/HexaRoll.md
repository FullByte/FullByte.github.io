# HexaRoll

Number of players: 2-4 Age range: 8 and up

Objective: The objective of the game is to be the first player to build a continuous chain of hexagonal tiles that connects opposite sides of the board.

Equipment:

- A board made up of hexagonal tiles (either paper or plastic)
- 4 sets of colored markers, one for each player
- 2 six-sided dice
- A scoring pad

Gameplay:

1.  Set up the board by placing all hexagonal tiles face down in a random order.
2.  Each player selects a color and places their markers on the start spaces on the board.
3.  Players take turns rolling the dice and using the resulting number to move their markers along the path of hexagonal tiles.
4.  If a player lands on an unoccupied tile, they turn it over to reveal either a plain hexagonal tile or a special tile.
5.  If a plain tile is revealed, the player can place one of their markers on the tile and add it to their chain.
6.  If a special tile is revealed, the player must follow the instructions on the tile. These could include:

- Moving in a specific direction
- Skipping a turn
- Rolling again
- Taking another turn immediately

7.  The game continues until one player has built a continuous chain of tiles connecting opposite sides of the board.
8.  The player who completes the chain first wins the game and scores one point.
9.  Play multiple rounds, keeping track of each player's score on the scoring pad. The player with the most points at the end of all rounds wins the game.

This game combines elements of luck and strategy, making it fun and challenging for players of all skill levels.
