# HexDraw

Number of players: 2-4 Age range: 10 and up

Objective: The objective of the game is to be the first player to fill all the hexagonal tiles on the board with their colored cards, forming a complete and uninterrupted pattern.

Equipment:

- A board made up of hexagonal tiles (either paper or plastic)
- A deck of cards, each with a different pattern on it, one pattern per player
- 4 sets of colored markers, one for each player
- 2 six-sided dice

Gameplay:

1.  Set up the board by placing all hexagonal tiles face down in a random order.
2.  Each player selects a color and takes the deck of cards corresponding to that color.
3.  Players place their markers on the start spaces on the board.
4.  Players take turns rolling the dice and using the resulting number to move their markers along the path of hexagonal tiles.
5.  When a player lands on a face-down tile, they turn it over. If the pattern on the tile matches the pattern on one of the player's cards, they can place the card on top of the tile and add it to their chain.
6.  If the player does not have a matching card, they draw one from the deck.
7.  If the player has a matching card, they must follow the instructions on the card. These could include:

- Moving in a specific direction
- Skipping a turn
- Rolling again
- Taking another turn immediately

8.  The game continues until one player has placed all their cards on the board, forming a complete and uninterrupted pattern.
9.  The player who completes their pattern first wins the game and scores one point.
10. Play multiple rounds, keeping track of each player's score on a scoring pad. The player with the most points at the end of all rounds wins the game.

This game combines elements of luck, strategy, and pattern recognition, making it an exciting and challenging experience for players of all ages.
