# LogicGate Duell

Idee: Das verrückte labyrinth mit logic gates? Am rand ist dann immer das ergebnis… man muss seine reihe in ein muster bekommen… und überall sind schalter die man erreichen muss und wenn man sie erreicht hat, ändern kann.

Number of players: 2 Age range: 12 and up

Objective: The objective of the game is to build a logic circuit that outputs the required signal using a combination of logic gates.

Equipment:

- A set of tiles, each representing a different type of logic gate (such as AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, and XNOR)
- A set of input tiles, numbered 1 to 4, representing the input signals
- An output tile, representing the final output signal

Gameplay:

1.  Set up the board by placing the input tiles at the top and the output tile at the bottom.
2.  Each player selects a set of logic gate tiles.
3.  Players take turns placing a logic gate tile on the board, connecting it to the input tiles and other logic gate tiles to build a logic circuit.
4.  The first player to create a circuit that outputs the required signal (for example, a "1" signal) wins the game.
5.  Players must follow the rules of Boolean algebra when placing their tiles, ensuring that the circuit they build is a valid logic circuit.

This game requires players to think logically and use their knowledge of Boolean algebra and logic gates to create a functioning circuit. It's a fun and challenging game for those who enjoy puzzles and logic problems.
