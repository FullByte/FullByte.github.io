# Vegas

Details on the original game can be found here: "[Vegas](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/117959/las-vegas)"

## Making the game

## Dice

For the game, you'll require a set of 40 dice, with eight dice in each of five distinct colors. Economically, it's often more sensible to buy a bulk set of 100 dice that come in 10 different colors. Opt for smaller-sized dice; not only are they more cost-effective, but they also enhance gameplay.

## Cards instead of dollars

In this variation of the original game, playing cards substitute for currency. Two decks of cards are required to play. Cards numbered 2 through 10 represent increments of $2000, starting at $2000 for the 2 card and reaching $10000 for the 10 card. As there are no cards to represent $1000, and the ace is not used, the minimum stake for each casino is raised from $5000 to $6000.

This also changes the distribution of cards as follows:

- 6x number 2
- 8x number 3
- 8x number 4
- 6x number 5
- 6x number 6
- 5x number 7
- 5x number 8
- 5x number 9
- 5x number 10

## Additional Rules

### Extra Role

Each player receives one poker chip, which can be utilized to re-roll an entire group of numbers. Prior to dealing the cards, a single chip is assigned to each casino through a random dice roll to determine its placement. Any chips that remain unused by the game's end will each contribute one point to the player's final score.

### Predict Wins

Place an extra die of your color, concealed, beside each bay to secretly forecast your finishing position, ranging from first (1) to fourth (4), with a prediction of non-involvement marked as six (6). Other players will simultaneously make their hidden predictions. For every prediction you make accurately, you will be awarded three bonus points.
