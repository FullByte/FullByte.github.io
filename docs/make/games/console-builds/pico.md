# Pico

[PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/) is a fantasy console for making, sharing and playing tiny games and other computer programs. It feels like a regular console, but runs on Windows / Mac / Linux. When you turn it on, the machine greets you with a command line, a suite of cartridge creation tools, and an online cartridge browser called SPLORE.

## Pico on Clockwork Gameshell

- Once purchased, visit the downloads page and download the Raspberry Pi version. This file has a filename similar to: pico-8_0.1.12c_raspi.zip
- Select TinyCloud on the Gameshell and copy the files using SCP. IP, username and password are displayed in TinyCloud.
- Make sure the file is named pico-8_0.1.11g_raspi.zip even if you downloaded a newer version and copy the zip file to ~/games/PICO-8/.
- Be careful not to select "Exit to Console" from the shutdown menu. This puts PICO-8 in its game developer mode. Hold down the GameShell's power button to reset if you get stuck here.
