This is a one-person operation.

Thanks for your interest!

Query a DNS for TXT records of [0xfab1.net](https://0xfab1.net) to get some contact details:

- Linux: ```curl -s -H 'accept: application/dns-json' 'https://cloudflare-dns.com/dns-query?name=0xfab1.net&type=TXT'  | jq -r .Answer[].data```
- Windows: ```(Resolve-DnsName 0xfab1.net -Type TXT | Select-Object -ExcludeProperty Strings).Text | Format-Table```

and you will receive this result:

``` sh
"v=me; github=https://github.com/FullByte"
"v=me; twitter=https://twitter.com/ZeroGdoubleD"
"v=me; about=https://0xfab1.net/about/"
"v=me; gravatar=https://de.gravatar.com/0xfab1"
```

My Unicode Hexadecimal (0xFAB1) is &#xFAB1;

I like to interpret this as being a terminal and GUI user :D I use the tool that works best for me and gets the job done. I have not subscribed to any IT religion, do not simp any technology evangelist and try to be as open as possible about knowledge and sharing information.

## Q&A

??? question "What was your most interesting online purchase?"
    In 2014 [I spent](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/tx/9e97ec563980c884b530faa2455013e947c26314e2e8a446456e1641a84471c0) [0.04911049 BTC](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=0.04911049+btc+in+euro&ia=cryptocurrency) for digital copy of the [50 Cent](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/50_Cent) Album [Animal Ambition](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Ambition). Curtis and I both forgot about it until suddenly BTC was worth a lot of money. As of today, this is my most expensive album purchase yet. No Ragrets :)
