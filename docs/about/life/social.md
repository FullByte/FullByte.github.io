## Advice

Some people don't want advice. They want you to listen.
If they want advice but it doesn't work, here are some possible reasons to reflect on:

| **Topic**                 | **Problem**                                                                 | **Solution**                                                                                        |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Mismatch with Situation   | Advice often doesn't consider the unique details of the individual's context.| Tailor advice to specifically fit the complexities and nuances of each situation.                   |
| Cognitive Bias            | People may ignore advice due to subconscious biases or reluctance to change. | Encourage self-awareness and challenge existing biases through reflective questioning.             |
| Lack of Detail            | General or vague advice fails to be actionable.                             | Provide specific, actionable steps and examples to clarify how advice can be implemented.          |
| Poor Timing               | Advice given when the recipient isn't receptive won't be effective.         | Choose an opportune moment for giving advice when the individual is most open to listening.        |
| Resistance to Change      | Natural resistance to change can prevent advice from being followed.        | Address emotional barriers and facilitate a supportive environment that encourages change.        |
| Overload of Information   | Too much advice can overwhelm and paralyze the decision-making process.     | Focus on delivering concise, prioritized advice rather than a multitude of options.                |
| Lack of Trust             | Lack of trust in the advisor can lead to skepticism about the advice given. | Build trust through empathy, consistent support, and by demonstrating understanding and expertise.|
| Perceived Patronization   | Advice may be perceived as patronizing, reducing its effectiveness.         | Ensure advice is delivered respectfully and considerately to foster a positive reception.          |
| Irrelevance of Advice     | Sometimes advice is not applicable because it's based on incorrect assumptions.| Verify assumptions and gather accurate information about the situation before advising.           |
| Unrealistic Expectations  | Expectations that advice alone will solve complex problems can lead to disappointment.| Set realistic expectations about what advice can achieve and emphasize effort and process.       |
