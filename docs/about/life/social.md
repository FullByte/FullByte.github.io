## Advice

Some people don't want advice. They want you to listen.
If they want advice but it doesn't work, here are some possible reasons to reflect on:

| **Topic**                 | **Problem**                                                                 | **Solution**                                                                                        |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Mismatch with Situation   | Advice often doesn't consider the unique details of the individual's context.| Tailor advice to specifically fit the complexities and nuances of each situation.                   |
| Cognitive Bias            | People may ignore advice due to subconscious biases or reluctance to change. | Encourage self-awareness and challenge existing biases through reflective questioning.             |
| Lack of Detail            | General or vague advice fails to be actionable.                             | Provide specific, actionable steps and examples to clarify how advice can be implemented.          |
| Poor Timing               | Advice given when the recipient isn't receptive won't be effective.         | Choose an opportune moment for giving advice when the individual is most open to listening.        |
| Resistance to Change      | Natural resistance to change can prevent advice from being followed.        | Address emotional barriers and facilitate a supportive environment that encourages change.        |
| Overload of Information   | Too much advice can overwhelm and paralyze the decision-making process.     | Focus on delivering concise, prioritized advice rather than a multitude of options.                |
| Lack of Trust             | Lack of trust in the advisor can lead to skepticism about the advice given. | Build trust through empathy, consistent support, and by demonstrating understanding and expertise.|
| Perceived Patronization   | Advice may be perceived as patronizing, reducing its effectiveness.         | Ensure advice is delivered respectfully and considerately to foster a positive reception.          |
| Irrelevance of Advice     | Sometimes advice is not applicable because it's based on incorrect assumptions.| Verify assumptions and gather accurate information about the situation before advising.           |
| Unrealistic Expectations  | Expectations that advice alone will solve complex problems can lead to disappointment.| Set realistic expectations about what advice can achieve and emphasize effort and process.       |

## Rules to live by

1. Gehe im Zweifelsfall vom Guten aus (lieber 1x verarscht werden als 100x kein vertrauen gezeigt)
2. Denke in Win-Win-Szenarien (Bei guten Deals gewinnen alle)
3. Verbessere die Welt - Stelle eine Frage (XXXXXX)
4. Zügle Deine Empathie (mitleiden), trainiere Dein Mitgefühl (Mitleid)
5. Versuche den Anderen zu verstehen; auch wenn Du kein Verständnis aufbringen kannst
6. Liebe Deinen Nächsten so wie auch andere ihre Nächsten lieben
7. Meide die Nachrichten (Mainstream Media, Personenbezogene Nachrichten und sensationsgeile Quellen)
8. Prügele Dich nicht mit Nazis (sei Schlau im Konter geben und demonstrieren)
9. Oute Dich (XXXXXX)
10. Sei realitisch (sei kein träumer und kein pessimist)

### More Rules

More good advice I collected from random places over time:

Showing sometimes is 50%:

- Quote: "Show up is better than not showing up" or "Anything worth doing is also worth doing half assed".
- Example: brushing ur teeth for 10 seconds is better than 0 seconds, etc. apply that to everything..
