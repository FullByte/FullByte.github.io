## Be like nature

Why fight the rules of nature?

1. Dislike squander: dW = 0 (Action W=∫L dt is minimized in every motion. Locally, L = Ekin-Epot)
2. Dislike hurrying: v ≤ c (Energy speed v is limited by the speed of light c.)
3. Dislike excessive force: F ≤ c^4/4G (Force F is limited by c and the gravitational constant G.)
4. Dislike sloth: W ≥ ℏ (action W is never smaller than the quantum of action ℏ.)
5. Dislike perfect order: S ≥ k (Entropy S is never smaller than the Boltzmann constant k.)

It's like then we'll start getting respect, and then we'll get more chicks and then like: with more chicks I go get more respect and after that we'll get like more money. It'll be like more money, more chicks, more respect... and just like keep on going. It all takes is getting that first chick.```
