# Digital lifestyle

## Mute stuff

Don't limit yourself in undesired ways but rather optimize how to consume information.

- Mute sounds that annoy and distract.
- Block users, unsubscribe or block mails - whatever is undesired should not reach your attention more than once.
- Disable popups and redirect/move messages that are just informational.
- Limit the number of services you use and actually use them.
- Be active, not passive: Don't behave based on triggers like notifications, sounds, new mails. Read whenever you make yourself time for it. (This works for work as well)
- Choose what to consume instead of consuming whatever is brought to you.

## File over app

The principle of valuing files above applications underscores the importance of producing lasting digital assets. These assets should be both manipulatable and stored in universally readable formats. Opt for tools that provide such adaptability.

To guarantee that your documents remain legible for generations to come, even on computers from the years 2050 or 2525, they should also be understandable on a system from the 1960s. The lasting impact of your digital work depends more on the files themselves than on the software tools with which they were made. While applications might become obsolete, files have the potential to persist. Consider the ancient hieroglyphs in the Egyptian pyramids - the messages they convey are more significant than the instruments used to etch them.

This principle can be extended to:

- Don't be dependent on services that you can avoid.
- If you use services understand how you can migrate to the next service before using it.
- Prefer offline working tools if possible and feasible.
- Keep it as simple and stupid as possible without limiting yourself on functions you need.

## Own a domain

Owning a domain makes moving mail services easier.
It also makes it possible to have endless aliases for various services. This allows username/mail AND password to be different for any service.

## Use a password manager

Until some distant future, passwords and 2FA will be the method of logging in to any service online.

- The amount of passwords = the amount of services you use. This will grow and quickly becomes unmanageable when following basic password guidelines (every password should be different, complex and changed regularly).
- You probably have more than one device on which you need your credentials. Password managers help you sync all credentials across your devices.
- If you have a partner and/or children sharing passwords is a thing. Password managers help.
- Password managers are not only ideal for credentials. Use them to store sensitive information of any kind you may need and comes in handy when you have access to one of your devices.
