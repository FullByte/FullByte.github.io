# Overview

Don't get serious advice from some random website, but hey, you are here, so enjoy my input :)

This is a collection of hand picked wisdom accumulated for the worthy. Hopefully there is something helpful in it for you. Most of this stuff is not mine, I just like to collect some of the stuff that helped me.

Let's start with some random quotes:

- A society grows great when old men plant trees in whose shade they shall never sit.
- It's okay to go through awful places, just don't stop and unpack.
- If you choose not to find joy in the snow, you will have less joy in your life, but the same amount of snow.

## Topics

All topics in this "life" section deal with wealth and prosperity. Wealth can be broadly defined as the abundance of valuable resources, assets, or possessions that contribute to an individual's or a group's well-being and ability to meet their needs or desires. While it is often associated with material assets like money, property, or investments, wealth encompasses much more than just financial riches. Some of these are covered here:

- [Financial wealth](finances.md)
- [Health for body and mind](health.md)
- [Projects and goals](projects.md)
- [Quotes](quotes.md)
- [Digital lifestyle](digital.md)
- [Social Wealth](social.md)

Some topics I will eventually cover later:

- Ideas (Intellectual Wealth)
- Heritage (Cultural Wealth)
- Freedom (Time Wealth)
- Fulfillment (Spiritual Wealth)
- Joy (Emotional Wealth)

I also collected and formulated some not so serious advice in the [fun](fun.md) chapter.
