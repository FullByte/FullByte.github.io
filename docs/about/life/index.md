# Overview

Don't get serious advice from some random website, but hey, you are here, so enjoy my input :)

This is a collection of hand picked wisdom accumulated for the worthy. Hopefully there is something helpful in it for you. Most of this stuff is not mine, I just like to collect some of the stuff that helped me.

Let's start with some random quotes:

- A society grows great when old men plant trees in whose shade they shall never sit.
- Its okay to go through awful places, just don't stop and unpack.
- If you choose not to find joy in the snow, you will have less joy in your life, but the same amount of snow.
