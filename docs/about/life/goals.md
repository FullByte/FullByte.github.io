## Get stuff done

- It's better to finish something than to start something
- Make goals that you have control over. Accept what you can not control or choose to be unhappy.
- Practice "Shoshikantetsu", japanese for "Complete what was originally intended."
- Practice "Ichigoichie", japanese for "Treasure every encounter, for it will never reoccur."

Follow this to get stuff done:

- Identify the problem
- Generate a list of potential solutions
- Evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of each potential solution
- Choose a solution to implement
- Implement the solution

### 110%

Never give 110%, that's just selling out... just divide your 100% in:

- 50% pain
- 20% skill
- 15% concentrated power of will
- 10% luck
- 5% pleasure

### Hard problems

Hard problems are hard - here is some advice:

- Say: "I can do hard things". Doing hard things has intrinsic value, and they will make me a better person, even if I end up failing.
- The key is recognizing that the urge to avoid hard things is human, and should be expected. It’s part of the process. Figure out what combination of motivation, and circumstances, and accountability work best for your particular personality.
- Break large goals down into manageable pieces. Creating an accurate road maps toward this goal. Find out what is important. Differentiate between activities you want to be important and what actually makes a difference.

### Productivity, purpose and passion

- You need to be efficient to have money and time to enjoy life.
- The parts of life that bring joy are often things we do for their own sake without caring about efficiency.
- The fear of the irrelevancy and losing out in the endless treadmill race impacts universally.
- To escape the productivity treadmill is to actively choose what matters to you.
- There are infinite things to do in your finite life so life is a set of choices.
- If you’re constantly craving more, you wont appreciate what you already have.
- If we believe the future will be better we devalue the present moment.
- Liberation of this burden happens when you are at peace with and bask at merely existing.

### Luck and Success

To be successful is to some extent luck. You can not control luck, but you can increase your chances by enlarging your success surface.

Enlarging the success surface with work:

- Level 1 - Do Nothing: You did nothing and just won randomly
- Level 2 - Hard work: Eventually there will be a payoff because you’ve hustled your way to it.
- Level 3 - Master: Discover things others don't see through work and knowledge.
- Level 4 - Attract: Others want to work with you; you can choose and select best opportunities.

Enlarging the success surface through networking:

- Level 1 - Do & Tell: Make something and tell others (Making and Marketing).
- Level 2 - Curiosity: Stay curious and try out new stuff.
- Level 3 - Talk to new people: Each new person you meet expands your surface area.
- Level 4 - Be known: Create value for people. Become known with something. Build a reputation.

Reflect what topics are important to you, what level you are on at this moment and what you can do to Enlarging the success surface with work and networking.
