# Final wisdom

A collection of hand picked wisdom accumulated for the worthy.

Advice is difficult to take in properly... no idea how you should do it; but do something.

## Smart Stuff

### 110%

Never give 110%, that's just selling out... just divide your 100% in:

- 50% pain
- 20% skill
- 15% concentrated power of will
- 10% luck
- 5% pleasure

### One sentance

Hard problems

- Say: "I can do hard things". Doing hard things has intrinsic value, and they will make me a better person, even if I end up failing.
- The key is recognizing that the urge to avoid hard things is human, and should be expected. It’s part of the process. Figure out what combination of motivation, and circumstances, and accountability work best for your particular personality.
- Break large goals down into manageable pieces. Creating an accurate roadmaps toward this goal. Find out what is important. Differenciate between activities you want to be important and what actually makes a difference.

Goals

- It's better to finish something than to start something
- Make goals that you have control over. Accept what you can not control or choose to be unhappy.

Random

- In der Menge liegt das Gift.
- Alles was man besitzt muss man auch pflegen.

### Investment

1. Don't buy, HODL

## Reflection

### What went well?

- What was I most proud of?
- When was I most happy? Why?
- What was my biggest win?
- What went better than expected?
- What did I spend the most time on?
- How did I spend my time best?
- What was my area of highest contribution?
- Who impacted me the most? Thank them.

Answer these three questions questions ...

- What went well? Why?
- Where did I make the most progress? What Steps did I take?
- What did I learn?

... for each of these three categories:

- Health (mental, physical)
- Wealth (career, investments)
- Relationships (love, friendships, interactions)

### What went poorly?

- What action am I least proud of? Why?
- What was my biggest loss?
- What made me miserable? How?
- What makes me most anxious? How?
- What went worse than expected?
- What held me back from doing what I want?
- What are the three worst things that happend?

Answer these three questions questions for each answer of the last question:

- What didn't go well and how could it have been avoided?
- Where did I make negative progress? What happened to cause it?
- What did I learn?

### Vision

With these three topics in mind what does the ideal near future look like?

- Health (mental, physical)
- Wealth (career, investments)
- Relationships (love, friendships, interactions)

Answer the following questions about the ideal near future:

- What of type of Person am I? Who do I want to become?
- What do I value the most? What are my top priorities?
- What drives me? What gets me motivated?
- What is my area of highest contribution?
- What do I say no to? What is essential to me? How can I stay focused on that?
- What do I spend the most time with? Who/what will I avoid from now?
- What is the one big thing I will achieve?

### Execute goals

Based on the last question, break down your big goal:

- To the next quarterly goal (review every 3 months)
- Define habits and actions to achieve the quarterly goal

## Fun Stuff

### Be like nature

Why fight the rules of nature?

1. Dislike squander: dW = 0 (Action W=∫L dt is minimized in every motion. Locally, L = Ekin-Epot)
2. Dislike hurrying: v ≤ c (Energy speed v is limited by the speed of light c.)
3. Dislike excessive force: F ≤ c^4/4G (Force F is limited by c and the gravitational constant G.)
4. Dislike sloth: W ≥ ℏ (action W is never smaller than the quantum of action ℏ.)
5. Dislike perfect order: S ≥ k (Entropy S is never smaller than the Boltzmann constant k.)

### The theory of the first chick

It all start with the first chick

- Transcript: ```It's like: We need to get a cool looking chick; maybe then people will start to respect us and stuff. It's like then we'll start getting respect, and then we'll get more chicks and then like: with more chicks I go get more respect and after that we'll get like more money. It'll be like more money, more chicks, more respect... and just like keep on going. It all takes is getting that first chick.```

## Protest

It is not easy to protest in a smart and effectiv way.

Here are some examples I like to create awareness to given Problem:

- [Ugly Gerry](https://fontsarena.com/ugly-gerry/) is a [free font](_gerry.otf.zip) created with real US congressional districts. The name comes from gerrymandering, the process that made possible such weird shapes.

- [Volkswagen](https://github.com/auchenberg/volkswagen) can be integrated in your CI process. It detects when your tests are being run in a CI server, and makes them pass. Volkswagen uses a defeat device to detect when it's being tested in a CI server and will automatically reduce errors to an acceptable level for the tests to pass. This will allow you to spend less time worrying about testing and more time enjoying the good life as a trustful software developer.
