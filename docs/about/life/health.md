# Health

Nobody will care more about your health than you.
Treat yourself well and your body will treat you well.
Take care of your physical health first, then keep doing that and take care of your mental health.

## Physical health

Good physical health relies on quality sleep, daily exercise, and a healthy diet:

- Establish good sleep habits: Quality sleep is essential for stress recovery. Understand your sleep needs and create a routine that supports restful sleep.
- Exercise daily: Physical activity helps the body manage stress hormones. Engage in daily movement, even in small amounts.
- Eat well: The gut-brain connection drives how we feel as we digest. Healthy food can be delicious. Preparing meals doesn't need to be time consuming.

### Exercise

A good daily routine is 100 push-ups, 100 sit-ups, 100 squats and a 10-kilometer run.

#### No free shower

Before stepping into the shower, ensure you've worked up a sweat. If your day mainly involves desk work, engage in activities like running to break a sweat before you bathe. Commit to exercising first so every shower feels truly deserved.

## Mental health

Maintaining good mental health involves self-care, building social support, and managing stress effectively:

- **Self-care**: Make time for self-reflection and self-awareness, and cultivate a positive self-image.
- **Social support**: Communicate openly and honestly with the people you trust and like. Social connections are essential for emotional well-being and provide a support network when you need help or someone to talk to.
- **Stress management**: Develop healthy coping mechanisms for dealing with stress and difficult emotions. Learn to recognize the signs of stress in your body and mind, and work on developing a proactive approach to managing stressors in your life.

### Emotions

Effectively managing emotions is vital for personal and professional growth, as it helps us make rational decisions, build healthier relationships, and create a positive environment.

- Feel and understand your emotions, but don't let them control you. For example, don't let fear guide your decisions.
- Stay objective and avoid taking things personally. Don't be easily offended.
- Focus on the present and learn from the past.
- Take time to think through your decisions rather than making hasty, emotional choices.
- Be open to dialogue and confront problems. A constructive disagreement is key to progress.
- Show respect and positivity by avoiding gossip.
- Acknowledge your own mistakes and discuss solutions and next steps with others to maintain credibility and authority.

### Mindfulness

Mindfulness is a skill that takes time to develop. Be patient with yourself and avoid self-criticism if your mind wanders or if you find it challenging at times. The goal of mindfulness is to bring present-moment awareness into your daily life. You can practice mindfulness while eating, walking, working, or interacting with others by staying fully engaged in the moment.

Prepare:

- Choose a quiet and comfortable place where you won't be disturbed. Sit, lie down or stand – whatever feels most comfortable for you.
- Start with a manageable amount of time, like 10 minutes and commit to it. Gradually increase time if desired.
- You can also use guided mindfulness meditation recordings or apps to help you get started. These often provide instructions and gentle reminders to stay present.

Practice:

- Close your eyes and take a few deep breaths to center yourself. Then, allow your breath to return to its natural rhythm. Focus your attention on the sensation of your breath as it enters and leaves your nostrils or the rise and fall of your chest.
- Your mind will likely start to wander. When it does, bring your focus back to your breath. You can use a mental cue like "inhale" and "exhale" to anchor your attention to the breath.
- Pay attention to the physical sensations associated with breathing. Notice how the air feels as it enters and exits your body, the temperature of the breath, and any other sensations that arise.

Consistency is key to developing mindfulness. Try to incorporate mindfulness into your daily routine, even if it's just for a few minutes each day.

### The power necessary to live happily (Ikigai)

The concept of Ikigai suggests living a life focused on personal satisfaction and societal contribution without a direct focus on financial gain or professional achievement.

Trust that success will be a byproduct of the meaning you find in daily experiences.

Follow these principles:

- Derive meaning from daily experiences and interactions, and remain curious about the world and oneself. (Pursuing a singular passion will not bring purpose to life)
- Embrace the journey of lifelong learning, appreciating the process of starting anew, making mistakes, and growing beyond comfort zones without the pressure of being an expert.
- Financial goals should not overshadow the pursuit of a meaningful life, advocating for financial comfort but recognizing wealth as a secondary outcome of living purposefully.
- Make a positive impact within your immediate circle and community, fostering meaningful connections and personal contributions to effect change.

### My rules

These are some more personal rules I have applied to keep focused on what I want, what makes me happy and helps me flourish; essentially helping me maintain a good mental health.

#### Understand your incentive

If you set goals be clear on why you want to achieve this goal. Usually this comes with downsides and setting the right priorities is essential for choosing the right path. However, be clear that the path usually is unknown to some extent and things will change. This is where your incentive kicks in and make a logical re-evaluation of the path chosen possible. Be true to yourself and understand your incentive when pursuing goals. Are you doing it for the right reasons? Is the reason you are doing something even achievable/still worth it or just a motivation to continue?

#### Do it anyway

If friends alter their plans or back out at the last moment, don't be deterred. Continue with your plans, and you might encounter new faces along the journey. Reconnect with the initial reason you wanted to participate and go for it. If socializing was the primary goal, communicate your feelings to those who cancelled. It's smart to plan events that aren't overly dependent on others, guaranteeing you can see them through. This strategy not only simplifies the planning process but also reduces the risk of letdowns. Additionally, embarking on a journey alone or with a different group frequently leads to unexpected experiences and the formation of new friendships.

#### Do nothing

Be able to do nothing. Allow yourself to unwind, releasing both the tension and the need for your actions to serve a specific purpose, even momentarily. Ultimately, action is inevitable, even if it manifests as mere stillness. The key to "Niksen", the dutch verb meaning "doing nothing", is to do nothing, without a purpose. As Olga Mecking puts it: "We always have in mind some kind of outcome. When we prepare meals, we think, ‘This meal will help me lose weight or will make me healthier.’ If we go for a walk, it has to be part of our 10,000 steps. So we lose that fun of just eating or just walking. So it’s about letting go of the outcome."

Consider this a mental exercise, akin to the mental equivalent of progressive muscle relaxation. While planning to engage in Niksen might seem contradictory, it's a valid approach. The more one practices Niksen, the more natural and spontaneous it becomes, transcending the need for deliberate planning.

## Habits

On average it takes around 66 days for a behavior to become automatic.
Consistency and persistence are key factors in successfully establishing a new habit.

### Forming a New Good Habit

Be patient and consistent when forming a new habit: start small, track your progress, and reward yourself.

- **Start Small**: Begin with a simple, achievable goal. For example, if you want to start exercising, commit to just 10 minutes a day.
- **Be Consistent**: Perform the new habit at the same time each day to establish a routine. Consistency helps to ingrain the habit.
- **Use Triggers**: Pair the new habit with an existing routine or cue, such as doing it right after brushing your teeth.
- **Track Your Progress**: Use a journal, app, to-do list, or calendar—whatever works best for you. Visualizing your consistency and progress is both rewarding and motivating.
- **Reward Yourself**: Allow yourself a small reward after completing the habit to reinforce the positive behavior.
- **Stay Patient**: Understand that forming a new habit takes time. Be patient and persistent.

### Getting Rid of Bad Habits

To effectively break bad habits, identify triggers and replace them with positive behaviors and reward yourself.

- **Identify Triggers**: Recognize what triggers your bad habit. It could be stress, boredom, or specific situations.
- **Replace with Positive Behavior**: Substitute the bad habit with a positive one. For example, if you bite your nails when stressed, try squeezing a stress ball instead.
- **Change Your Environment**: Modify your surroundings to avoid triggers. If junk food is your weakness, keep healthier snacks at hand.
- **Use Reminders**: Place visual or auditory reminders to avoid the bad habit. Sticky notes or alarms can be effective.
- **Find Support**: Share your goal with a friend or join a support group. Accountability can help you stay on track.
- **Practice Self-Compassion**: Don’t be too hard on yourself if you slip up. Recognize it as a learning opportunity and get back on track.
