### Zocki

First recorded Zocki event happened in 9.9.2019.

The **Zocki-Ten-Fight** is an epic battle over 10 games in local mulitplayer mode.

To determin the winner we use the following scoring per game:

| Place | Score |
|-------|-------|
| 1     | 4     |
| 2     | 2     |
| 3     | 1     |
| 4     | 0     |

Should there be a tie for first place between:

- 2 players after all 10 games one match of "Not Not - A Brain Buster", "Super Bloody Hockey" or "Nidhogg2" will determine the winner.
- 3 players after all 10 games one match of "Wand Wars" or "Astro Bears" will determine the winner.
- 4 players after all 10 games one match of "Wand Wars" or "Astro Bears" will determine the winner.

## LAN Party

Playing games locally in a network requires some preparation and some tools help get organized. Here are some notes I made on the topic :)

Preparing:

- [ ] Make a list of all games that will be played and make sure all have downloaded, updated and started the game atleast once prior to the LAN party (see [games](#games) for example)
- [ ] Send a list of things to think about e.g. Equipment, Snaks, Sleeping bag
- [ ] Make sure everyone is clear on when it starts and ends and where to show up
- [ ] Make sure everyone helps setup and clean up

Gamers Equipment

- [ ] Power supply
- [ ] Headphones
- [ ] Mouse
- [ ] Keyboard
- [ ] Screen
- [ ] PC
- [ ] Cables for PC

Gamers Equipment

- [ ] Snacks and drinks
- [ ] Sleeping bag

On Site:

- [ ] Use power from different rooms and check for enough poweradapters
- [ ] Check for enough chairs and tables
- [ ] The LAN cables are long enough and you have enough free LAN ports

### Scan and Test Network

Have a look if you can see everyone in the LAN:

- You can scan the network to see who else is already visible: ```nmap -sC -sV 192.168.178.0/24```
- And/Or run a simple ARP command to see who you already see: ```arp -a```
- Test a connection to a given IP e.g.: ```Test-NetConnection -ComputerName 192.168.178.41 -InformationLevel "Detailed"``` (optionally add a port e.g. "-Port 3389")

### Share Files

Easiest way to share files ist by ziping whatever you want to share first.

You can run a simple webserver using python: ```python -m http.server 8080```

### Windows Firewall

Check your inbound rules and possibly add a rule/remove a restricition:

``` ps1
Get-NetFirewallRule | Where { $_.Enabled -eq 'True' -and $_.Direction -eq 'Inbound' } | Select-Object DisplayName, Direction, Action, Profile | FT
```

Alternativly, add firewall rules to allow all local traffic (same subnet):

``` ps1
New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "Allow LAN Party OUT" -Direction Outbound -LocalPort 1-10000 -Protocol TCP -RemoteAddress LocalSubnet -Action Allow
New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "Allow LAN Party IN" -Direction Inbound -LocalPort 1-10000 -Protocol TCP -RemoteAddress LocalSubnet -Action Allow
```

Remove the rules from above:

``` ps1
Remove-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "Allow LAN Party OUT"
Remove-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "Allow LAN Party IN"
```

Or, if nothing helps, disable the Firewall for your current profile during the LAN event: ```netsh advfirewall set currentprofile state off```

You can reset your firewall settings as follows. Windows will then ask you whenever you start an application what to do with this currently blocked application.

``` ps1
(New-Object -ComObject HNetCfg.FwPolicy2).RestoreLocalFirewallDefaults()
```
