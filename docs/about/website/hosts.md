# Hosts

I am trying out new services and if the host websites i try to run 0xfab1.net. Here ist an overview of what I have tried and what is currently running parallel to the main page on Github Pages:

## Hosting Services

This website is hosted/built using the following services:

| Service                                                  | Direct Link                                                     | 0xfab1 CNAME                      |

Services to try:

- [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)
- [Gitlab Pages](https://about.gitlab.com)
- [Surge](https://surge.sh/)

I tried these services but they didn't suit me for my deployment at the time tested*:

- [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) - php workaround breaks other builds
- [edg.io](https://edg.io/) - annoying DNS and build setup
- [Fly.io](https://fly.io/) - complicated build/requires extra files and github action changes
- [Firebase](https://console.firebase.google.com/) - complicated build/requires extra files and github action changes
- [Feta](https://www.deta.sh/) - complicated build/requires extra files and github action changes
- [Hostman](https://hostman.com) - no free option
- [Qovery](https://console.qovery.com) - looks great but didn't get it to work for simple static websites
- [Statically](https://statically.io) - great for one-pagers, not suitable for 0xfab1.net
- [Linode](https://www.linode.com) - no free option
- [koyeb](https://app.koyeb.com) - account closed for unknown reason
- [Railway](https://railway.app) - worked fine until beginning of 2023 when the pricing model changed and the basic service was no longer free

*happy to learn from you how I can use them using a simple, automated deployment method for my static website :)
