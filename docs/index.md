Publishing my projects and notes has been great exercise for me.
As longs as this works well for me I will continue doing so :)

The content of this site is mainly written in english, aside of some very few german posts.
I hope you appreciate the lack of ads and pop-ups.

Use the navigation menu on the left or the search bar on the top right to find the topics of interest.

I appreciate your pull-request on GitHub for typos/errors in existing pages.
