[Publishing](https://proven.lol/d72627) my [projects](make/index.md) and [tech notes](tech/index.md) has been great exercise for <a rel="me" href="https://social.lol/@yolo">me</a>. The [content](https://0xfab1.net/sitemap) of [this site](about/0xfab1/index.md) may appear random as it deals with whatever I find interesting and noteworthy ```¯\_(ツ)_/¯```

Use the navigation menu on the left (hidden as hamburger menu if screen size is small) or the search bar on the top right to find topics of interest. Toggle between light and dark with the switch next to the search bar. I hope you appreciate the lack of ads and pop-ups.

I appreciate your [pull request](https://github.com/FullByte/FullByte.github.io#contribute) for any errors in existing pages. If you think something is generally wrong, I missed to link you where appropriate or just want to reach out, please [contact me](about/me/contact.md)!

Regards,
