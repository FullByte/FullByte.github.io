Publishing my projects and notes has been great exercise for <a rel="me" href="https://social.lol/@yolo">Mastodon</a>. As longs as this works well for me I will continue doing so :)

The content of [this site](/about/0xfab1.net) may appear random as it deals with whatever I find interesting and noteworthy ```¯\_(ツ)_/¯```.

I hope you appreciate the lack of ads and pop-ups. Use the navigation menu on the left or the search bar on the top right to find topics of interest.
Toggle between light and dark mode, depending on what your prefer.

I appreciate your [pull-request on GitHub](https://github.com/FullByte/FullByte.github.io#contribute) for typos/errors in existing pages.
If you think something is generally wrong or I missed to link you where appropiate, please [let me know](/about/contact)!

Enjoy the [content](https://0xfab1.net/sitemap) and find your visit worthwhile :)

Regards,
