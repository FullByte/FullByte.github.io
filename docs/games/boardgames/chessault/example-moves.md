# Example Moves

## Explode

Examples:

![Explode_Killzone](_killzone1.drawio.svg)

The player with the explosion ability can use the explosion optionally after moving. In this case all figures are hit within the radius.

![Explode_Killzone](_killzone2.drawio.svg)

Although figures can not attack the recruitment area, an explosion will kill all figures in range including the recruitment area.
