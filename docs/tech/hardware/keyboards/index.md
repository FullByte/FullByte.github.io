Generally there are few things to say:

- Standards are easier to get caps for

## Keyboard layouts

### Key layout

### Winkeyless (WKS)

A WKL keyboard, also known as a Winkeyless keyboard, is a keyboard that does not have the Windows (between left CTRL and left ALT) and the application (between right CTRL and right ALT) key.

In a standard WKL layout, the places of these keys are left empty with no other key to replace them.

### Tenkeyless (TKL)

While tenkeyless gets its name from 10 number keys on the Numpad, tenkeyless keyboards do not contain a Numpad at all, so they actually have 17 keys less than a full-sized 104-key keyboard.

## Key Caps

### Form

Rember that depending on the profile the key caps need to be formed differently, depending in which row they are.

Depending on the brand, the key caps may not be standard. In this example there is a logitech cap (left) next to a regular cap (right):

**O-rings**

O-rings can be a good option if you want to dampen the noise and make your keyboard more quiet. O-rings can ruin the typing experience of your keyboard if you’re not careful.
