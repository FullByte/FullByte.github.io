### Winkeyless (WKS)

A WKL keyboard, also known as a Winkeyless keyboard, is a keyboard that does not have the Windows (between left CTRL and left ALT) and the application (between right CTRL and right ALT) key.

In a standard WKL layout, the places of these keys are left empty with no other key to replace them.

### Tenkeyless (TKL)

While tenkeyless gets its name from 10 number keys on the Numpad, tenkeyless keyboards do not contain a Numpad at all, so they actually have 17 keys less than a full-sized 104-key keyboard.

**O-rings**

O-rings can be a good option if you want to dampen the noise and make your keyboard more quiet. O-rings can ruin the typing experience of your keyboard if you’re not careful.
