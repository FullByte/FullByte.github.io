# PETSCII

​PETSCII (PET Standard Code of Information Interchange), is a character set developed by Commodore for their 8-bit computers. (see also CBM-ASCII or PET-ASCII). This set extends the 1963 version of ASCII, incorporating graphical symbols alongside standard alphanumeric characters. These graphical symbols enabled users to create simple, character-based graphics, facilitating game development and enhancing the visual capabilities of Commodore computers. The character set operates in two modes:​

- Unshifted Mode: Includes uppercase letters and a variety of graphical symbols.​
- Shifted Mode: Provides both uppercase and lowercase letters, with some graphical symbols replaced by lowercase characters.​

Users can toggle between these modes to access the desired set of characters. Additionally, PETSCII includes control characters that manage cursor movement and screen functions, such as clearing the screen or returning the cursor to the home position, allowing for dynamic text and graphics manipulation within programs. The inclusion of graphical symbols in PETSCII facilitated the creation of blocky, pixelated images, leading to a unique art form known as PETSCII art, showcasing the creative potential of character-based graphics on Commodore computers.
