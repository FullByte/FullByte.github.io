# BBS

A [bulletin board system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system) or **BBS** is a computer server running software that allows users to connect to the system using a terminal program. Once logged in, the user can perform functions such as uploading and downloading software and data, reading news and bulletins, and exchanging messages with other users through public message boards and sometimes via direct chatting. In the early 1980s, message networks such as FidoNet were developed to provide services such as NetMail, which is similar to internet-based email.

This technology is still alive, active and well :)
