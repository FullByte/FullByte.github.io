## Piet

Hello World in [Piet](https://www.dangermouse.net/esoteric/piet/samples.html) with the matching pixel art by Kelly Boothby.

Another great work of art is [Matthias Ernst](https://lutter.cc) [piet programm](https://lutter.cc/piet/) which inteprets [brainfuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck).

There are also attempts to write a piet program and a piet like art work.

One last great example for a piet program which I like a lot is by Richard Mitton. This program calculates an approximation of pi by dividing a circular area by the radius twice. A more accurate value can be obtained by using a bigger program and therewith circle :)

## AllRGB

The objective of [allRGB](https://allrgb.com/) is simple: To create images with one pixel for every RGB color (16,777,216); not one color missing, and not one color twice.

[This picture](https://allrgb.com/recursive) from [yashe](https://allrgb.com/yashe) includes the code it was made by. ([backup](allrgb-recursive.png))
