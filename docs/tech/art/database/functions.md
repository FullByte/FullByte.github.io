## Redis

### LOLWUT

LOLWUT is a command in Redis that is designed to be entertaining and not technologically useful.

From the code: "This file implements the LOLWUT command. The command should do something fun and interesting, and should be replaced by a new implementation at each new version of Redis."

Running LOLWUT results in an artwork inspired by Georg Nees "Schotter", Plotter on paper, 1968. "Schotter" is a computer graphic created in the 1960s using a structured process with random generators. This artwork illustrates the interplay between order and disorder, as well as the impact of change.
