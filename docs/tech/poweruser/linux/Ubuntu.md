# Linux / Ubuntu

Most commands listed here will work on any linux distributions but if in doubt it will most likely run on the latest Ubuntu.
Great tool to understand commands: <https://explainshell.com/>

## Basics

Random basics

- Check installed packges ```sudo tasksel```
- Update and upgrade ```sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y```
- Upgrading to a newer release ```do-release-upgrade```
- Check who is online ```w```
- Show all system users ```cut -d: -f1 /etc/passwd```
- Top commands used ```history | awk 'BEGIN {FS="[ \t]+|\\|"} {print $3}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr```
- Commands only used once ```history | awk 'BEGIN {FS="[ \t]+|\\|"} {print $3}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n | grep ' 1 '```

Get system details

- Get all enviornment variables ```printenv```
- Get all configuration variables ```getconf -a```

## Create the boot script

Example script that install updates to ubuntu automatically

The script "bootupdate.sh":

```shell
#!/bin/bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
exit 0
```

Move "bootupdate.sh" to init.d

```shell
mv bootupdate.sh /etc/init.d/bootupdate.sh
```

Add script to boot sequente

```shell
update-rc.d bootupdate.sh start 2
```

- hard wipe a disk: ```sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda```

**DU:** Disk usage command is used for quickly estimating the drive space used in a folder or partition

- Show files and sort by size: ```/data/java$ du -sh * | sort -h```

**DF:** Used for estimating disk space but for the entire disk rather than a directory or folder.

- show which partition is how much full: ```df -h```

## MORE STUFF

- Execute a command and report statistics about how long it took: ```time <cmd>```
- Send a process in current tty into background and back to foreground: ```CTRL + z ; bg; jobs; fg```

            echo -ne "\e[$x;$i;$a""m\\\e[$x;$i;$a""m\e[0;37;40m "
        done
        echo
    done
done
echo ""
```

## String Manipulation

## Work with a file

- Cat A File With Line Numbers: ```cat -n file```
- Line count in a file: ```wc -l <file>```
- Count unique words in a file: ```cat file.txt | xargs -n1 | sort | uniq -c```

- Get The Unix Timestamp: ```date +%s```
- Hexdump A Compiled File  ```cat Hello.class | hexdump -C ```
- Grep For Files Without A Match: ```grep -L "foobar" ./*```

**Grep For Files With Multiple Matches**

Get a list of filenames that contain both a line with `@media only screen` and a line with `.class-name`.
If you need to, chain more `grep` commands on to narrow things down even farther.

```bash
$ grep -rl "@media only screen" src/css |
    xargs grep -l ".class-name"
```

## Network Stuff

- Find Device in Monitoring Mode: ```iwconfig 2>/dev/null | grep "Mode\\:Monitor" | awk '{print $1}'```
