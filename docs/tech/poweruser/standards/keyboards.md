### Winkeyless (WKS)

A WKL keyboard, also known as a Winkeyless keyboard, is a keyboard that does not have the Windows (between left CTRL and left ALT) and the application (between right CTRL and right ALT) key.

In a standard WKL layout, the places of these keys are left empty with no other key to replace them.

### Tenkeyless (TKL)

While tenkeyless gets its name from 10 number keys on the Numpad, tenkeyless keyboards do not contain a Numpad at all, so they actually have 17 keys less than a full-sized 104-key keyboard.

**Keycap Profile**

| Keycap Profile | Description                                                                                       |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| OEM            | The keycap profile you’ll find on most keyboards. Mass produced, considered standard. Angled top. |
| Cherry         | Very similar to OEM profile, but shorter.                                                         |
| DSA            | Slightly shorter profile with spherical top.                                                      |
| XDA            | Medium height profile with spherical top.                                                         |
| SA             | Tall height profile with slightly spherical and angled top.                                       |

**O-rings**

O-rings can be a good option if you want to dampen the noise and make your keyboard more quiet. O-rings can ruin the typing experience of your keyboard if you’re not careful.
