### Pixels per Inch

To calculate Pixels per Inch:

![screen PPI formula](_screens_PPI_formula1.jpg)

​​For example, for a 5-inch screen with a resolution of 1920 x 1080:

![screen PPI formula](_screens_PPI_formula2.jpg)

So, the PPI would be approximately 440.58 for this screen.

Some other examples:

- 13.3" @ 1080p = 165.63 PPI
- 22" @ 1080p = 100.13 PPI
- 25" @ 1080p = 88.12 PPI
- 22" @ 1440p = 133.51 PPI
- 24" @ 1440p = 122.38 PPI
- 25" @ 1440p = 117.49 PPI
- 27" @ 1440p = 108.79 PPI
- 32" @ 1440p = 91.79 PPI
- 27" @ 4k = 163.18 PPI
- 36" @ 4k = 122.38 PPI
- 50" @ 4k = 88.12 PPI
