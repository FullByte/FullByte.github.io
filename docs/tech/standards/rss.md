# RSS

RSS (Rich Site Summary or Really Simple Syndication) is a format for delivering regularly changing web content. Many news-related sites, blogs, and other online publishers syndicate their content as an RSS Feed.

## YouTube

There are 3 RSS feed types for YouTube:

- User : <https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?user=>
- Channel : <https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=>
- Playlist : <https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?playlist_id=>

## GitHub

Add ".atom" to a given commit link to get an RSS Reader update on a given file/folder or the entire project.

For example:

- Link: <https://github.com/FullByte/FullByte.github.io/commits/main>
- RSS Feed: <https://github.com/FullByte/FullByte.github.io/commits/main.atom>

Add the atom link to your rss feed reader to get notified on updates.
