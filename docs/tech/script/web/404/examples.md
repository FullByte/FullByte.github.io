## Financial Times

[Financial Times 404 Error page](https://www.ft.com/0xfab1):

Why wasn't this page found?

We asked some leading economists.

- Stagflation: The cost of pages rose drastically, while the page production rate slowed down.
- General economics: There was no market for it.
- Liquidity traps: We injected some extra money into the technology team but there was little or no interest so they simply kept it, thus failing to stimulate the page economy.
- Pareto inefficiency: There exists another page that will make everyone better off without making anyone worse off.
- Supply and demand: Demand increased and a shortage occurred.
- Classical economics: There is no such page. We are not going to interfere.
- Keynesian economics: Aggregate demand for this page did not necessarily equal the productive capacity of the website.
- Malthusianism: Unchecked, exponential page growth outstripped the pixel supply. There was a catastrophe, and now the population is at a lower, more sustainable level.
- Neo-Malthusianism: To avoid unchecked, exponential page growth outstripping the pixel supply and leading to an inevitable catastrophe, we prevented this page from being conceived.
- Marxism: The failure of this page to load is a consequence of the inherent contradictions in the capitalist mode of production.
- Laissez Faire Capitalism: We know this page is needed, but we can't force anyone to make it.
- Monetarism: The government has limited the number of pages in circulation.
- Efficient Markets Hypothesis: If you had paid enough for the page, it would have appeared.
- Moral Hazard: Showing you this page would only encourage you to want more pages.
- Tragedy of the Commons: Everyone wanted to view this page, but no-one was willing to maintain it.
- Game theory: By not viewing this page you help everyone else get better pages.
- Mercantilism: The page is hosted by a foreign web server and is therefore banned to ensure the supremacy of our own software.
- Trickle-down: High taxes on content publishers prevented them hiring the person who would have written this page.
- Speculative bubble: The page never actually existed and was fundamentally impossible, but everyone bought into it in a frenzy and it's all now ending in tears.
- Socialism: If you were to get the page you wanted you might get a better page than someone else, which would be unfair. This way at least everyone gets the same.
- Behavioural economics: The influence of psychological factors caused you to act in a manner that would not be expected of a purely rational actor.
- Theory of the second best: The best outcome was unachievable, so you have arrived here instead.
