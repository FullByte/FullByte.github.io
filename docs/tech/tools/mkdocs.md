# mkdocs

[MkDocs](https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/) is a great way to host a simple, static website. This website uses [Material for MkDocs](https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material). Material for MkDocs is a theme for MkDocs, a static site generator geared towards (technical) project documentation. 

Use docker or python to quickly create and host a static website.

## Container

```shell
git clone https://github.com/FullByte/FullByte.github.io.git # clone repo
cd FullByte.github.io # Go to main folder
docker run --rm -it -p 8000:8000 -v ${PWD}:/docs squidfunk/mkdocs-material # run the container
```

## Python

Run this once to install all requirements:

```shell
choco install -y python
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install mkdocs
pip install mkdocs-material
```

Run this in the folder of the mkdocs.yml file to host the mkdocs page:

```shell
mkdocs serve
```

Currently Mkdocs does not yet support 3.9.x. This may change soon and be outdated, however the general problem of having different python versions installed may still be relevant. To solve the problem, [download](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and install the latest supported python version e.g. 3.8.x.

In case you have multiple python versions installed (like me) you need to explicitly mention to use 3.8.x! Run ```py â€“list``` to get your 3.8.x version. Mine is -3.8-64; your version may vary. Run this to install the mkdocs dependencies:

```shell
py -3.8-64 -m pip install --upgrade pip --user
py -3.8-64 -m pip install mkdocs
py -3.8-64 -m pip install --upgrade mkdocs-material
```

Then run this in the main folder with mkdocs.yml file

```shell
py -3.8-64 -m mkdocs serve
```
