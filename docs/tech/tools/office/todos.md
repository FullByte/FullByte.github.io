# TODO

In my opinion there is no best TODO list, task organizer or productivity app. Here is why I think that way:

All todos break down in these categories:

- Tasks that are done on a given day and time:
  - because they need to be done at that given day and time (due dates, appointments, events, ...)
  - could be done anytime but today is the day and after one session the task is done (write post about TODO lists and tools, go to the gym, bake cake,...)
- Tasks that have repeating due dates:
  - regular activity (sport, friends,...)
  - habit forming activity (quit smoking, do 100 pushups)
- Tasks that are more like projects or ideas (fix that thing somehow, how to get rich, make something nice for wife, write a program that knows it better...)
- Tasks that are lists (grocery list, small tasks, packing lists)

Why write down tasks and todos anyway?

- Habit forming
- Forgetful
- Feels good to check off things
- Keep track of what I did
- Track time spent on task

For all of the above there is not that one best tool. Of course this is heavily opinionated; the solution must work for you and your lifestyle and preferences but this is what works for me:

- All tasks for a given day are in my (digital) calendar including repeating, regular activities.
- For habit forming tasks I use an app on my phone (currently streaks).
- Lists, projects and ideas are either in obsidian (private) or this blog (public)
- When sharing todos (e.g. groceries) I prefer todoist

It is important to me to keep the process simple, backed up and easy to change the underlying service (mail/calendar, habit tool, markdown-based notes app). It is also important to me that the todos, tasks and ideas are at the right place. Everything in one tool would not work and too many tools is too many. The right amount is 3 :)

- Fastmail (paid)
- Obsidian (paid for sync)
- Todoist (free)

I don't really count Streaks and this could be covered with Todoist but a habit forming tool needs to be super fast and easy to use and for me this needs to be on a mobile device as widget.
