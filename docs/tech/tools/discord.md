## AI

"Clyde" is Discord's new (2023) AI Chatbot.

Mine serves butter and does this very well.

The chat is pleased with Clyde's service

I thought there may a slim chance Clyde uses this question to reply "Butter time!" but fortunately the bot remembered it is only butter time if butter is requested. Nice!
