Remember:

- Don't over-analyze this topic unless you have fun doing so.
- It is a good experince to build your own PC. Sometimes it is however easier and cheaper to go with some prebuilt machine.
- Do not buy an OS (e.g. Windows) if you can choose to exclude it.
- Once the components you desire are cheaper, new components will be available which you will then desire.
- If you buy a laptop, make sure things can be repaired/changed/upgraded easily.
