# Suno

Suno is a great service to create songs.

## Audio Issues

The following are parts of songs that didn't work out as expected.

I think the result is interesting anyway - Text input was german. Output sounds a little like german but is nonsense:

<audio controls><source src="_KI-random-shit1.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"></audio>

<audio controls><source src="_KI-random-shit2.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"></audio>

<audio controls><source src="_KI-random-shit3.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"></audio>
