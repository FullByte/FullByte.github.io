# VScode

The combination of [Github CoPilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) + [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [GitHub Copilot for Azure](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azure-github-copilot) provides an interactive experience through the @azure chatbot, enabling developers to learn about Azure services, manage resources, diagnose issues, monitor costs, and utilize the Azure Developer CLI (azd).

Here are some possible use cases:

- Understanding Azure services like AI, compute, containers, databases, and security.
- Comparing services (e.g., Azure Container Apps vs. Azure Kubernetes Service).
- Fetching information on resources (e.g., URLs of web apps).
- Summarizing resource usage and answering resource-specific queries.
- Diagnosing problems with Azure services like API Management, Kubernetes, or Redis.
- Summarizing logs for applications in services like Azure Container Apps.
- Estimating and reviewing historical Azure costs.
- Identifying the most expensive resources in a subscription.
- Searching and deploying application templates.
- Receiving step-by-step deployment guidance.
