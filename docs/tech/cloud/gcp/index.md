## Requester pays

TIL: Google Cloud offers a function for its storage solution: "Requester Pays". With this model, the costs for downloading data are not borne by the provider, as is usually the case, but by the user who downloads the data. This principle makes it easier and cheaper for providers of publicly accessible data, as they do not have to pay for unexpectedly high download numbers or unauthorized access. This allows them to make their data widely accessible without the risk of unforeseeable costs.
