## RSS Feed for Commits

Add ".atom" to a given commit link to get an RSS Reader update on a given file/folder or the entire project.

For example:

- Link: <https://github.com/FullByte/FullByte.github.io/commits/master>
- RSS Feed: <https://github.com/FullByte/FullByte.github.io/commits/master.atom>

Add the atom link to your rss feed reader to get notified on updates.
