A collection of hand picked wisdom accumulated for the worthy.

Advice is difficult to take in properly... no idea how you should do it; but do something.

Never give 110%, that's just selling out... just divide your 100% in:

- 50% pain
- 20% skill
- 15% concentrated power of will
- 10% luck
- 5% pleasure

## Smart Stuff

- Say: "I can do hard things". Doing hard things has intrinsic value, and they will make me a better person, even if I end up failing.
- Make goals that you have control over. Accept what you can not control.
- The key is recognizing that the urge to avoid hard things is human, and should be expected. Itâ€™s part of the process. Figure out what combination of motivation, and circumstances, and accountability work best for your particular personality.
- Break large goals down into manageable pieces. Creating an accurate roadmaps toward this goal. Find out what is important. Differenciate between activities you want to be important and what actually makes a difference.
- In der Menge liegt das Gift.
- Alles was man besitzt muss man auch pflegen.
- It's better to finish something than to start something
