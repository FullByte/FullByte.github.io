Welcome to 0xfab1.net!

By accessing this blog, you agree to the following terms and conditions, most of which are entirely unnecessary but included here because everyone loves a good laugh:

---

### 1. **No Guarantees, Just Vibes**
This website is provided "as is," which is a fancy way of saying, "I make no promises this thing will work, look good, or even make sense."

---

### 2. **Copyright? Sure, Why Not**
All content on 0xfab1.net is owned by me, except the stuff I obviously borrowed from the internet (with love, while drinking free beer). Please donâ€™t sue me; Iâ€™ll bake you cookies instead (batteries not included, terms and conditions may apply).

---

### 3. **Liability? Nope.**
If you:
- Laugh too hard and spill your coffee, 
- Misunderstand my jokes and embarrass yourself, or 
- Use this site as a substitute for professional advice, Iâ€™m not responsible.

Sorry, not sorry.

---

### 4. **Cookies, But Not the Tasty Kind**
This website may or may not use cookies. Honestly, I have no idea how they work, but if your browser asks about them, just know they're not the chocolate chip variety.

---

### 5. **User Conduct**
By visiting this site, you agree to:
- Laugh at my bad jokes.
- Not judge my web design skills.
- Send me memes when applicable.

Violations may result in sternly worded emails... or not. Iâ€™m pretty laid back.

---

### 6. **Privacy Policy**
Your privacy is respected here. I don't sell your data because that sounds like a lot of work and trouble.
If I find your personal info, itâ€™s probably because you left it in the comments.
I do use umami (https://umami.is/) to see if anybody is reading my stuff.
Feel free to opt out with an adblock tool of your choice :D

---

### 7. **Termination Clause**
I reserve the right to terminate this website at any time, usually because I got bored or forgot to pay for hosting. No hard feelings, right?

---

### 8. **Governing Law**
This website operates under the highly official and universally binding jurisdiction of "Just Having Fun."
